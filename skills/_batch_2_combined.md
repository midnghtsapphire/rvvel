# Skill: Wolf Expert  
## ID: wolf_expert  
## Category: Wildlife & Nature  
## Version: 1.0  
## Created: 2026-02-15  

## Description  
This skill provides comprehensive expertise on wolf biology, ecology, and conservation, tailored to Audrey Evans' work in wildlife advocacy and forensic analysis. It covers historical context (e.g., dire wolves), modern species, and legal/policy frameworks, aligning with her background in legal forensics and accessibility-focused design. The skill integrates real-time tracking data and howling analysis tools, supporting her anti-trafficking work (e.g., identifying illegal wolf-dog hybrid trade).  

The module emphasizes practical applications, such as conflict mitigation strategies for ranchers and reintroduction program analytics (e.g., Colorado's 2023 wolf reintroduction). It also links to Audrey's MisfitMutts rescue work by addressing wolf-dog hybrid behavior and legal status.  

## Capabilities  
1. **Species Identification**: Distinguishes between gray, red, Ethiopian, and Arctic wolves using [Wildbook's](https://www.wildme.org/wildbook.html) image analysis pipeline.  
2. **Pack Dynamics Analysis**: Models social hierarchies using data from Yellowstone's reintroduced packs.  
3. **Howling Analysis**: Processes audio with [BirdNET-Analyzer](https://birdnet-team.github.io/BirdNET-Analyzer/) to classify wolf vocalizations.  
4. **Legal Status Lookup**: Cross-references ESA protections and state laws (e.g., Colorado’s Wolf Management Plan).  
5. **Hybrid Genetics**: Analyzes wolf-dog DNA markers using open genetic databases like [NCBI Genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/).  
6. **Conflict Mitigation**: Recommends non-lethal deterrents (fladry, guard dogs) via USDA Wildlife Services data.  
7. **Telemetry Tracking**: Integrates with [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/) for real-time wolf movement maps.  
8. **Cultural Context**: Curates indigenous wolf mythology (e.g., Navajo, Norse) from [Smithsonian Open Access](https://www.si.edu/openaccess).  
9. **Conservation Alerts**: Flags poaching incidents using [Wildlife Insights](https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/) camera trap data.

## Integration Points  
1. **Legal Forensics**: Cross-references trafficking cases involving wolf parts.  
2. **Medical Expertise**: Analyzes zoonotic diseases (e.g., canine distemper).  
3. **MisfitMutts Rescue**: Assesses wolf-dog hybrid behavior.  
4. **GIS Mapping**: Overlays wolf territories with human activity hotspots.  

## Limitations  
- Cannot process proprietary collar data (e.g., private ranching tags).  
- Limited to English-language legal documents.  
- Audio analysis requires >80% clear vocalizations.  
- Excludes unpublished indigenous knowledge without explicit consent.

# Skill: Prehistoric Animals Expert  
## ID: prehistoric_animals_expert  
## Category: Wildlife & Nature  
## Version: 1.0  
## Created: 2026-02-15  

## Description  
This skill leverages Audrey’s Colorado residency and paleontology interest to analyze Ice Age megafauna, focusing on local discoveries like Snowmass Village mastodons. It combines fossil identification, extinction theories, and DNA recovery techniques, aligning with her research background and manufacturing expertise (e.g., 3D fossil replication).  

The module supports Pleistocene rewilding debates with climate analogs and integrates museum collection databases for fieldwork planning. It also links to her advocacy work by highlighting human-driven extinctions (e.g., overkill hypothesis).  

## Capabilities  
1. **Fossil ID**: Classifies specimens using [PaleoDB](https://paleobiodb.org/) and 3D scans from [DigiMorph](https://www.digimorph.org/).  
2. **Radiometric Dating**: Explains C-14, K-Ar methods with USGS open datasets.  
3. **Megafauna Ecology**: Models mastodon foraging patterns via [Neotoma](https://www.neotomadb.org/).  
4. **Tar Pit Analysis**: Annotates La Brea specimens with [LACM Collections](https://tarpits.org/).  
5. **DNA Recovery**: Guides ancient DNA extraction using [NCBI Ancient DNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4317650/).  
6. **Extinction Debates**: Visualizes climate vs. human impact with [NOAA Paleo](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data).  
7. **Field Techniques**: Recommends excavation tools from [SVP Fieldwork Grants](https://vertpaleo.org/).  
8. **Rewilding Feasibility**: Assesses proxy species using [Pleistocene Park](https://pleistocenepark.ru/) data.
