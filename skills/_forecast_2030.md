# Skill: Quantum Computing Applications Expert  
## ID: quantum_computing_applications_expert  
## Category: Quantum Technology  
## Version: 1.0  
## Created: 2026-02-15  

## Description  
This skill enables Audrey to design and implement quantum algorithms for her inventions (e.g., Ground-Penetrating AI Detection, Satellite-Assisted Missing Persons) using hybrid quantum-classical systems. It covers Qiskit, quantum machine learning, and optimization for real-world problems like logistics (Freedom Angel Corps operations) and materials science (Tiki Washbot nanomaterials). The skill integrates with her existing cybersecurity expertise to implement quantum-resistant cryptography.  

Based on [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12107), it includes protocols for distributed quantum sensing networks—critical for her drone/satellite systems. Special focus is given to error mitigation techniques for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, aligning with [IBM Quantum Learning](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning) best practices for utility-scale quantum computing.  

## Capabilities  
1. Design quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization (e.g., missing persons search patterns)  
2. Implement quantum machine learning for deepfake detection enhancement  
3. Develop quantum-safe encryption for GlowStarLabs products  
4. Optimize supply chains using quantum annealing (e.g., YumYumCode logistics)  
5. Simulate nanomaterials for Tiki Washbot coatings  
6. Hybridize classical AI with quantum kernels for satellite image analysis  
7. Deploy quantum cloud workflows via AWS Braket/IBM Quantum  
8. Benchmark quantum vs. classical approaches for trafficking pattern recognition  
9. Apply quantum sensing principles to improve vagus nerve stimulation  
10. Translate quantum research into patent applications

- Q# (Microsoft Quantum SDK)  

## Integration Points  
- Integrates with her Satellite-Assisted Missing Persons system for quantum-enhanced search  
- Enhances Deepfake Detection with quantum ML  
- Provides optimization for Freedom Angel Corps logistics  

## Limitations  
- Limited by current NISQ device qubit counts (<1000 qubits)  
- Requires classical pre/post-processing for most real-world applications  
- High latency for cloud-based quantum hardware

# Skill: Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Expert  
## ID: brain_computer_interface_expert  
## Category: Neurotechnology  
## Version: 1.0  
## Created: 2026-02-15  

## Description  
This skill enables Audrey to design non-invasive BCI systems for her AI Companion Dog and medical inventions, leveraging EEG/EMG signal processing and neural decoding. It incorporates [Wikiversity's BCI course](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Brain-Computer_Interfaces) fundamentals with advanced transfer learning techniques for small datasets (critical for trafficking survivor rehabilitation).  

Specializes in hybrid BCI-AI architectures that combine wearable sensors with edge AI—key for her vagus nerve stimulator. Includes ethical frameworks from [Stanford's Quantum Principles](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Kop-et-al_10-Principles-for-Responsible-Quantum-Innovation.pdf) for neuroprivacy compliance.  

## Capabilities  
1. Design EEG-based control systems for assistive devices  
2. Implement artifact removal pipelines for mobile BCIs  
3. Train hybrid CNN-LSTM models for intention decoding  
4. Develop neurofeedback protocols for PTSD treatment

7. Create adaptive interfaces for neurodegenerative diseases  
8. Apply federated learning for privacy-preserving BCI data  
9. Prototype dry electrode arrays for home use  
10. Validate BCI systems with clinical trial protocols  

## Triggers  
- "Design a BCI control scheme for the Companion Dog"  
- "Process this raw EEG dataset for attention decoding"
