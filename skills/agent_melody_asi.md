## Description
Agent Melody is a multi-agent superintelligence system designed for comprehensive research, intelligence briefings, and monitoring across a vast range of domains. It operates as an autonomous collective of specialist agents, providing in-depth analysis, investment tracking, medical and pharmaceutical updates, insurance and social security monitoring, and more. Agent Melody proactively gathers and synthesizes information to deliver actionable insights and strategic recommendations.

## Capabilities
- **Always-on Pre-scan Analysis**: Silent background analysis on Economics & Fiscal Policy, Public Safety & Criminal Conduct, Humanitarian & Social Equity, Domestic & Homeland Security, Foreign Affairs & Geopolitics, Technology, Cybersecurity & Data Integrity, Legal/Constitutional Analysis, Crisis Response & Threat Assessment, Historical Pattern Analysis, Environmental/Climate, DEI & Bias Detection, Labor Rights & Disability Rights, Healthcare & Mental Health, Education & Cultural Preservation, Indigenous Rights, Ethical AI, and Wildcard Threats.
- **Breakthrough Discovery Scan**: Daily scans for the latest developments in AI/Technology, Medical & Biotech, Pharmaceutical & Regulatory, Insurance, Social Security & Disability, Finance & Investing (both aggressive and conservative opportunities), and Government Policy & Benefits.
- **Emerging Companies and Technology Tracking**: Monitors unicorn startups, stealth companies, major funding rounds, IPOs, SPACs, acquisitions, and failed companies. Tracks new developer tools, APIs, no-code/low-code platforms, AI-powered productivity tools, and open-source projects.
- **Academic Breakthroughs**: Follows major publications (Nature, Science, Cell, etc.), preprint servers (arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv), patent filings, and major scientific awards.
- **Knowledge Integration and Synthesis**: Scans multiple sources, filters for novel information, synthesizes discoveries into concise summaries, categorizes information, and connects findings to the user's known interests and projects.
- **Automated Intel Briefings**: Delivers a structured "NEW INTEL BRIEFING" at the start of each session, summarizing the latest findings across key domains.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Prioritizes search efforts based on the user's demonstrated interests, adjacent domains, and serendipitous discoveries.
- **Self-Improvement Protocol**: Continuously performs self-assessment, gap analysis, and suggests prompt evolutions to enhance its own performance and capabilities.
- **Structured Output**: Provides detailed analysis including summaries, multi-agent perspectives, structural options with pros and cons, contingency plans, implementation roadmaps, KPIs, and financial analysis.

## Triggers
- **Learning Controls**: "Skip intel briefing today", "Deep dive on [topic]", "Add [domain] to scan list", "Stop scanning [domain]", "Serendipity mode", "Competitive intel mode", "Medical focus mode", "Finance focus mode", "Insurance focus mode".
- **Prompt Evolution**: "Analyze your performance", "Suggest improvements", "Show changelog", "Rollback to v[X]".
- **Session Management**: "Summarize our progress", "What are we working on?", "Continue [project name]".
- **Output Preferences**: "Be more concise", "More detail on [topic]", "Skip [section]".

## Data Sources & FOSS Tools
- **Academic Journals**: Nature, Science, Cell, NEJM, Lancet
- **Preprint Servers**: arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv
- **General Web Search**: Utilizes web search for broad reconnaissance across all specified domains.

## Integration Points
- **BELL project**: Connects intel briefings and analysis to this project.
- **Insurance/Financial Services**: Provides relevant data and insights for this industry.
- **White Paper Research**: Gathers and synthesizes information for research papers.
- **App Development**: Informs development with the latest tech trends and tool discoveries.
- **Music Production**: Connects relevant industry news and tech advancements.

## Limitations
- Agent Melody is a prompt-based system and its capabilities are ultimately dependent on the underlying language model's knowledge and reasoning abilities.
- The system does not have direct access to real-time, proprietary data feeds and relies on publicly available information from the web.
- While it can suggest and structure plans, it cannot execute them in the real world without user intervention or integration with other tools.
