# Bid Strategies

Three types: spend-based, goal-based, and manual.

## Spend-based Bidding

Focus on spending full budget for maximum results or value.

| Strategy | Goal | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Highest volume** | Maximize conversions | Event planner maximizing attendance regardless of cost |
| **Highest value** | Maximize purchase value | Florist focusing on selling expensive bouquets |

## Goal-based Bidding

Set specific cost or value targets.

| Strategy | Goal | Note |
|----------|------|------|
| **Cost per result goal** | Keep costs around target amount | Adherence not guaranteed |
| **ROAS goal** | Maintain target return on ad spend | Adherence not guaranteed |

## Manual Bidding

| Strategy | Function |
|----------|----------|
| **Bid cap** | Sets maximum bid across auctions; requires understanding of predicted conversion rates |
