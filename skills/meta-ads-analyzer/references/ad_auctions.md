# Ad Auctions

Meta uses auctions to determine the best ad for each opportunity. Billions occur daily.

## Auction Mechanics

A person can fall into multiple target audiences. All ads targeting that person compete.

## Winner Determination

Highest **total value** wins:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Bid** | What advertiser pays for desired outcome |
| **Estimated action rates** | Probability of engagement or conversion |
| **Ad quality** | Feedback, hiding behavior, low-quality assessments |

## Key Insight

> An ad more relevant to a person can win against higher bids.

- Higher bids don't guarantee wins
- Improving relevance can reduce costs
- System rewards ads providing user value

## Analysis Implications

- Low delivery may indicate low total value, not just low bid
- High CPAs may result from low estimated action rates or quality
- Improving creative quality can be more effective than increasing bids
- Audience-creative fit directly impacts auction competitiveness
