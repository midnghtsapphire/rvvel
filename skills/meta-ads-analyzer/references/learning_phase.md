# The Learning Phase

The learning phase is when the delivery system explores the best way to deliver a new or significantly edited ad set.

## Key Mechanics

- **Delivery column** shows "Learning" during this phase
- Exits after ~**50 results** within 7 days of last significant edit
- **Shops ads exception:** Requires 17 website purchases + 5 Meta purchases

## Characteristics During Learning

- Performance is less stable
- CPA is typically higher
- Results are not indicative of long-term performance

## Best Practices

1. **Don't edit during learning** — resets the process
2. **Avoid unnecessary edits** — only edit when likely to improve performance
3. **Avoid high ad volumes** — fragments learning across too many ad sets
4. **Use realistic budgets** — too small or inflated gives inaccurate signals

## Learning Limited

When ad set can't get enough results to exit learning, status shows **"Learning limited"**.

## Analysis Implications

- Don't make definitive judgments during learning phase
- Significant edits require another ~50 results to stabilize
- Factor learning status into any performance evaluation
