# Pacing

Pacing ensures budget is spent evenly over ad set schedule and helps meet bid strategy cost goals.

## Two Aspects

| Type | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Budget pacing** | Distributes budget across campaign duration |
| **Bid pacing** | Adjusts bids to meet cost goals while maintaining delivery |

## Why It Matters

**Without pacing:** Campaign starting during high-competition period could exhaust budget in days on expensive results, missing cheaper opportunities later.

**With pacing:** Budget reserved for later when lower-cost results may be available.

## Analysis Implications

Pacing explains why:
1. Daily spend varies even with consistent budgets
2. System "holds back" during expensive periods
3. End-of-period spending differs from early periods
4. Cost efficiency should be evaluated over full campaign, not daily snapshots

When analyzing fluctuations, consider whether pacing is optimizing for overall campaign efficiency rather than daily consistency.
