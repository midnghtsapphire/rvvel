# Performance Fluctuations

Ad performance naturally fluctuates. Understanding causes helps distinguish normal variation from actual problems.

## Common Causes

| Cause | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Learning phase** | New/edited ad sets unstable | Wait for ~50 results |
| **Audience saturation** | Too much frequency | Expand audience or refresh creative |
| **Auction dynamics** | Competition changes | Monitor trends over time |
| **Seasonality** | Behavior changes by period | Compare to historical same periods |
| **Creative fatigue** | Effectiveness decreases | Rotate creative regularly |
| **External factors** | News, events, platform changes | Account for context |

## Normal vs. Concerning

**Normal:**
- Day-to-day CPA variation within 20-30%
- Weekend vs. weekday differences
- Gradual changes over weeks
- Variation during learning phase

**Concerning:**
- Sudden, sustained cost increases (>50% for multiple days)
- Delivery dropping to near zero
- Conversion rate declining while spend increases
- Performance degradation after no changes

## Before Diagnosing Problems

1. Is ad set still in learning phase?
2. What's baseline for normal variation?
3. Are there external factors?
4. Is sample size sufficient?

Evaluate over appropriate windows—typically 7+ days for stable ad sets.
