# Auction Overlap

When ad sets have overlapping audiences, multiple ads from your Page may enter the same auction. Meta chooses the highest total value ad; others are excluded (not competing against yourself).

## Impact on Performance

- Prevents ads from entering auctions
- Can prevent ad sets from spending full budget
- Can prevent achieving enough results to exit learning phase
- Results in less predictable performance when scaling

**Note:** Separate Pages don't avoid overlap if same ad account, campaign, or ad set share audience/assets.

## Diagnosis Methods

1. **Opportunity score recommendations** in Account Overview
2. **Automated rules** to detect and manage overlap

## Solutions

1. **Combine similar ad sets** — consolidates learning, faster stable results
2. **Turn off overlapping ad sets** — typically the learning limited or lowest-result ones; move budget to active ad set
