# Ad Relevance Diagnostics

Diagnostics to understand whether ads were relevant to the audience reached. Use to identify adjustments to creative, post-click experience, or targeting.

## The Three Diagnostics

| Diagnostic | Measures |
|------------|----------|
| **Quality ranking** | Perceived quality vs. competitors for same audience |
| **Engagement rate ranking** | Expected engagement vs. competitors |
| **Conversion rate ranking** | Expected conversion vs. competitors with same optimization goal |

## Important Notes

- **Not available** for ads with <500 impressions
- **Not auction inputs** — diagnostic tools only
- More relevant ads typically cost less and see more results

## Diagnosis Guide

| Ranking Scenario | Likely Issue | Action |
|------------------|--------------|--------|
| Low Quality | Creative perceived as low quality | Improve creative, reduce clickbait |
| Low Engagement | Ad not compelling | Test new angles, improve hook |
| Low Conversion | Post-click experience issues | Optimize landing page, check audience-offer fit |
| All rankings low | Audience-creative mismatch | Reconsider targeting or creative strategy |
