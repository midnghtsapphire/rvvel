# Prompts Directory

This directory contains Audrey Evans' master prompts stored as raw files, separate from the skill definitions.

## Purpose

The prompts directory serves as a repository for complete, unmodified meta-prompts and system prompts that Audrey has developed for various AI agents and systems. These are stored in their original form to preserve the exact structure, formatting, and content as designed.

## Distinction from Skills

While the `/home/ubuntu/skills/` directory contains structured skill files that follow a standardized format (with sections like ID, Category, Description, Capabilities, etc.), this `prompts/` subdirectory contains the **raw source prompts** themselves.

Think of it this way:
- **Skills** = Documentation and metadata about how to use a capability
- **Prompts** = The actual instructions and system configurations for AI agents

## Files in This Directory

- `agent_melody_asi_prompt.md` - The complete master meta-prompt for Agent Melody ASI, a multi-agent superintelligence system for research, intelligence briefings, and comprehensive monitoring across domains.

## Usage

These prompts can be:
- Referenced when setting up new AI agent instances
- Modified and customized for specific use cases
- Studied to understand the architecture of complex multi-agent systems
- Used as templates for creating new specialized agents

## Maintenance

When adding new prompts to this directory:
1. Save the complete, unmodified prompt text
2. Use descriptive filenames that indicate the agent or system name
3. Include a header noting the original author and purpose
4. Consider creating a corresponding skill file in the parent `/home/ubuntu/skills/` directory for documentation
