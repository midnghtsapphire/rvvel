## Category: AI Development & Research
## Version: 1.0
## Created: 2026-02-15

## Description
This skill provides expert knowledge on Anthropic's Claude Code, a command-line AI coding agent. It covers its functionality, subscription requirements, privacy policies, API usage, and a comparative analysis of alternative tools like Cursor, Cline, and Aider, particularly in the context of OpenRouter integration.

## Capabilities
- **Detailed Explanations**: Can describe what Claude Code is, how it works as an agentic AI, its key features (project-level understanding, terminal integration), and its technical architecture.
- **Subscription & Pricing Analysis**: Can break down the costs associated with Claude Code, including the Free, Pro, and Max plans, and explain the trade-offs between a monthly subscription and pay-as-you-go API usage.
- **Privacy Policy Assessment**: Can detail Anthropic's data retention and training policies for both consumer and commercial users, and explain available privacy controls.
- **API Usage Guidance**: Can clarify whether Claude Code can be used via an API key without a Pro subscription and outline the limitations of API-only access (token costs, rate limits).
- **Alternative Tool Comparison**: Can provide an overview of alternative AI coding assistants like Cursor, Cline, Aider, and Continue.dev, including their features, pricing, and how they integrate with OpenRouter.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Can compare the costs of Claude Pro, direct API usage, and various alternatives to determine the most cost-effective option for different user profiles (light vs. heavy users).
