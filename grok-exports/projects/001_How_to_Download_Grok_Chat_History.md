Grok (from xAI) doesn't have a simple one-click "Download all chats" button like some other AI platforms, but there are a few reliable ways to export or save your chat history as of 2026. Here's a breakdown of the main options:

### 1. Official Full Account Data Export (includes all conversations)
This is the most comprehensive official method and pulls your entire Grok chat history along with other account data.

- Go to: **https://accounts.x.ai/data** (sign in with your xAI/Grok credentials if needed).
- Look for the **"Download account data"** section.
- Click **"Download"** or **"Request archive"** to start the export process.
- xAI will prepare a data package (often in JSON/HTML format) that includes your conversations, and you'll get a link to download it once ready (may take minutes to hours depending on volume).

This method is mentioned in several guides and aligns with standard data export practices for privacy rights.

### 2. For individual conversations (quick & built-in options)
- Open Grok at **https://grok.com** or in the app.
- Go to your chat history (usually via the history icon in the top right — looks like three lines + magnifying glass).
- Open the specific conversation.
- Look for a **Share** button (top right or below the chat) → this creates a public link you can copy/save.
- Some responses now have a **three-dot menu** with **"Export to PDF"** for single responses or threads.
- Manual copy: Select all text in the chat (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A), copy, and paste into a document (Notepad, Word, Google Docs, etc.).

### 3. Browser Extensions & Third-Party Tools (for easier/bulk exports)
If you want nicer formats (PDF, Markdown, TXT) without manual copying:
- **Chrome Web Store extensions** like:
  - "Grok Exporter" or "Grok PDF"
  - "YourAIScroll" (supports Grok + many other AIs, exports to multiple formats)
  - "ConvoSnap Exporter"
- Install one, open your Grok chat, and use the extension's button to export the current conversation.
- Userscripts like **Enhanced Grok Export** (via Greasy Fork + Tampermonkey) add an export button directly on grok.com or x.com/grok for Markdown, PDF, etc.

These are popular workarounds since built-in per-chat export is limited.

Note: Grok conversations are tied to your account, and exports may vary slightly depending on whether you're using grok.com, the mobile app, or the X integration. If you're in a region with strong privacy laws (like GDPR/CCPA), you can also submit a formal data request via xAI's privacy portal for more complete exports.

If none of these match what you're seeing in your interface or you need help with a specific chat, let me know more details!
