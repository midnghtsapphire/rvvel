Who owns nobu

---

## Message 2 - ASSISTANT

**Nobu**, the renowned global chain of Japanese-Peruvian fusion restaurants and luxury hotels, is primarily owned by a group of founders and investors through Nobu Hospitality, LLC.

### Key Owners:
- **Robert De Niro**: The actor and co-founder who played a pivotal role in launching the brand after discovering chef Nobu Matsuhisa's cuisine in the late 1980s.
- **Nobu Matsuhisa (Nobuyuki Matsuhisa)**: The celebrity chef who developed the signature style blending Japanese techniques with Peruvian ingredients; he opened the first Nobu in New York City in 1994.
- **Meir Teper**: A film producer and entrepreneur who joined as a key investor and partner from the start.
- **Drew Nieporent**: Restaurateur and operator through the Myriad Restaurant Group, involved in the original joint venture and ongoing operations, particularly for U.S. locations.
- **James Packer**: Australian billionaire investor, part of the majority ownership board for Nobu Hospitality, with additional stakes from entities like Crown Resorts (about 20% in some ventures).

The company has expanded to over 50 restaurants and several hotels worldwide as of 2025, but ownership remains concentrated among these core figures without a single dominant owner.

Wondering gift receipt name

---

## Message 4 - ASSISTANT

It sounds like you’re asking about the recipient of a gift related to Nobu, possibly from a previous conversation, but the context is a bit unclear. Since we were just discussing Nobu’s ownership, I’ll assume you might be referring to gifting something related to Nobu (e.g., a dining experience, gift card, or merchandise) and need clarification on whose name to put on a gift receipt.

If you’re asking about a gift receipt for a Nobu-related purchase:
- **Recipient Name**: You’d typically put the name of the person you’re gifting the item to on the gift receipt. For example, if you’re buying a Nobu dining gift card for a friend named John Doe, you’d list “John Doe” as the recipient.
- **Nobu’s Role**: Nobu (the restaurant/hotel group owned by Robert De Niro, Nobu Matsuhisa, Meir Teper, etc.) doesn’t directly influence the gift receipt process. You’d follow standard procedures for the platform or location where you’re purchasing (e.g., Nobu’s website, a specific restaurant, or a third-party like OpenTable).

If you meant something more specific—like a particular gift, a different context, or a specific Nobu location—please clarify details such as:
- What type of gift (e.g., gift card, reservation, merchandise)?
- Which Nobu location or platform you’re purchasing from?
- Is this tied to a prior conversation or specific person/event?

Alternatively, if you’re asking about something unrelated to Nobu or have a specific memory in mind (since I have access to prior chats), let me know more details, and I can tailor the response. If you want to manage or delete any related conversation history, you can do so in the "Data Controls" section of your settings or delete specific conversations to remove them from my memory.

What’s the exact gift or context you’re thinking of?

When gifting a no boo gift certificate who will it be charged from

---

## Message 6 - ASSISTANT

When gifting a Nobu gift certificate, the charge will typically come from the entity processing the transaction, which depends on where and how you purchase it. Here’s a breakdown based on available information:

- **Purchasing from Nobu Directly**: If you buy a gift certificate through Nobu’s official website (e.g., noburestaurants.com) or at a Nobu restaurant location, the charge will likely appear from **Nobu Hospitality, LLC** or the specific restaurant’s operating entity (e.g., “Nobu New York” or “Nobu Miami”). The exact name on the charge depends on the location and their payment processor but will generally reflect the Nobu brand or the specific restaurant’s legal name.

- **Third-Party Platforms**: If you purchase a Nobu gift card through a third-party provider like OpenTable, GiftRocker, or a similar service, the charge will likely come from that platform (e.g., “OpenTable” or “GiftRocker”) rather than Nobu itself. For example:
  - **OpenTable**: If you buy a digital gift card for Nobu via OpenTable, the charge may show as “OpenTable” or a related entity.
  - **Gift Card Retailers**: If purchased through retailers like Amazon or a general gift card marketplace, the charge will reflect that retailer’s name.

- **Credit Card Statement**: The name on your credit card statement might not always say “Nobu” explicitly. It could include the restaurant’s location (e.g., “Nobu Malibu LLC”) or the payment processor’s name (e.g., “Square” or “Stripe” for online purchases). For in-person purchases at a Nobu restaurant, it’s typically the restaurant’s legal name or a variation like “Nobu [City].”

- **Ownership Context**: While Nobu is owned by Robert De Niro, Nobu Matsuhisa, Meir Teper, Drew Nieporent, and investors like James Packer, their names won’t appear on the charge. The transaction is processed through the business entity (Nobu Hospitality or a specific restaurant’s LLC), not the individual owners.

### Recommendations:
- **Check the Purchase Platform**: Before buying, confirm whether you’re purchasing directly from Nobu (via their website or restaurant) or a third-party site, as this determines the charge name.
- **Contact Nobu for Clarity**: If you need the exact name for the charge (e.g., for accounting or gifting purposes), contact the specific Nobu location or their customer service (available on noburestaurants.com) to ask how it will appear.
- **Gift Receipt Details**: If you’re concerned about the gift certificate’s presentation, Nobu’s digital or physical gift cards typically allow you to personalize the recipient’s name, but the charge itself is separate and tied to your payment method.

If you have a specific Nobu location in mind (e.g., Nobu Los Angeles, Nobu London) or a platform you’re planning to use, let me know, and I can refine the answer. Also, if this relates to a prior conversation or specific gift details, please share more context, and I can tailor the response further. If you want to manage related conversation history, you can delete it in the “Data Controls” section of your settings.

I know I think they have an umbrella name over all their

---

## Message 8 - ASSISTANT

You’re likely referring to the overarching entity that manages all Nobu locations, which would be the "umbrella name" for their operations when purchasing something like a gift certificate. Based on the context of your question about who a Nobu gift certificate would be charged from, here’s the clarified answer:

### Umbrella Name for Nobu:
The overarching entity for Nobu’s restaurants and hotels is **Nobu Hospitality, LLC**. This is the primary business entity that oversees the global Nobu brand, including its restaurants, hotels, and related operations. When you purchase a gift certificate directly from Nobu (e.g., through their official website, noburestaurants.com, or at a Nobu location), the charge is most likely to appear under **Nobu Hospitality, LLC** or a variation tied to the specific restaurant’s legal name (e.g., “Nobu [City] LLC” or “Nobu Restaurants”).

### Details on Charges:
- **Direct Purchases**: If you buy a gift certificate from Nobu’s website or a Nobu restaurant, the charge on your credit card statement will typically reflect **Nobu Hospitality, LLC** or the specific location’s operating entity (e.g., “Nobu New York” or “Nobu Malibu LLC”). The exact name depends on the payment processor and location.
- **Third-Party Platforms**: If you purchase through a third-party like OpenTable, GiftRocker, or another gift card provider, the charge will come from that platform (e.g., “OpenTable” or “GiftRocker”), not Nobu Hospitality directly.
- **Consistency Across Locations**: Since Nobu Hospitality is the umbrella entity, even location-specific charges are often tied back to this parent company, though the statement might show a localized name for operational purposes (e.g., “Nobu Las Vegas” for a Vegas purchase).

### Additional Notes:
- **Ownership**: While Nobu Hospitality is co-owned by Robert De Niro, Nobu Matsuhisa, Meir Teper, Drew Nieporent, and investors like James Packer, the charge won’t reflect their individual names—just the business entity.
- **Gift Certificate Specifics**: Nobu gift cards (physical or digital) are typically issued under the Nobu brand, and the charge will align with Nobu Hospitality or the specific restaurant’s LLC. You can personalize the recipient’s name on the certificate, but the charge name remains tied to the processing entity.
- **Verification**: To confirm the exact charge name for a gift certificate, you can:
  - Check the terms on noburestaurants.com when purchasing.
  - Contact the specific Nobu location or their customer service (via the website or by calling a restaurant).
  - Review your credit card statement after a test purchase, if applicable.

If you meant something more specific by “umbrella name” (e.g., a different corporate entity, a specific location, or another aspect of Nobu’s operations), or if you’re referring to a particular gift certificate purchase scenario, please provide more details. Also, if this ties to a prior conversation or you want to manage related chat history, you can delete it in the “Data Controls” section of your settings. Let me know how I can refine this further!
