If you tell me how wide “the corridor” is (tight = Wellington/Ft Collins/Loveland/Greeley/Evans/Garden City; wide = add Eaton/Ault/Severance/Windsor)

The **"corridor"** you're referring to appears to be the informal local term for the main urban/suburban growth and commuting zone in Northern Colorado (NoCo), centered along the I-25 and parallel corridors like US-85/US-287, stretching roughly from Fort Collins southward through Loveland and into the Greeley area (and often blending into the broader Front Range Urban Corridor).

- **Tight version** (Wellington / Fort Collins / Loveland / Greeley / Evans / Garden City): This is the core, more densely connected strip. It runs primarily north-south, with Fort Collins and Loveland in Larimer County, and Greeley/Evans/Garden City in Weld County. The north-south span is about **35–45 miles** (e.g., Wellington to central Greeley is roughly 35–40 miles driving), but the east-west width is narrower—often just 5–15 miles wide in the built-up areas, hugging the highways and avoiding much farther east/west sprawl.

- **Wide version** (adding Eaton / Ault / Severance / Windsor): This expands the effective footprint eastward, incorporating more of eastern Larimer and western Weld Counties. These towns (Severance, Windsor, Eaton, Ault) sit in the "Windsor corridor" or along/near CO-392 and US-85, pulling the eastern edge out farther.

  The added width comes from the east-west spread: from western Fort Collins edges to eastern Greeley/Evans is already ~20–25 miles in places, but including Windsor/Severance (east of I-25) and Eaton/Ault (farther east/northeast along US-85) pushes the practical "corridor" width to **~30–40 miles** east-west at its broadest points in the middle (e.g., from west Fort Collins to east of Greeley/Windsor area).

In rough straight-line/approximate driving terms:
- Tight corridor east-west width: Often **10–20 miles** across the main urbanized parts.
- Wide corridor east-west width: Closer to **25–40 miles**, especially if measuring from far western Fort Collins outskirts to Ault/Eaton areas.

This "tight vs. wide" distinction shows up a lot in local real estate, services, commuting, and development talk—tight is the I-25 spine and immediate satellites, while wide captures the growing eastern suburban/exurban fill-in along the parallel highways. If this is for housing, traffic, or service area context, the wide version basically adds that extra eastern layer of faster-growing towns like Windsor and Severance. Let me know if you need distances between specific pairs or a map visualization idea!

Both versions of **"the corridor"** in Northern Colorado (NoCo) refer to the interconnected urban/suburban zone along the northern Front Range, primarily in Larimer and Weld Counties. This is the fast-growing area tied together by I-25 (north-south spine), US-34, US-85, and CO-392 (east-west connectors), where people commute, shop, and live between the anchor cities of Fort Collins and Greeley.

- **Tight corridor** (Wellington → Fort Collins → Loveland → Greeley → Evans → Garden City):  
  This is the core I-25-focused strip, hugging the main highway and immediate surroundings. It's the "spine" most locals mean when talking about daily commutes, services, or the primary growth zone.  
  - North-south length: Roughly **35–45 miles** (Wellington at the north end to central Greeley/Evans at the south).  
  - East-west width: Narrower, typically **10–20 miles** across the built-up/urbanized areas (from western Fort Collins edges to eastern Greeley/Evans, but mostly concentrated closer to I-25). Garden City is a small enclave right next to Greeley, so it doesn't add much extra spread.

- **Wide corridor** (adding Eaton → Ault → Severance → Windsor):  
  This broader take incorporates the eastern suburban/exurban expansion in western Weld County and eastern Larimer County. These towns are growing fast as "drive-till-you-qualify" bedroom communities for Fort Collins/Loveland jobs, pulling the footprint farther east along US-85 and parallel roads. Windsor and Severance sit east of I-25 (often called the "Windsor corridor"), while Eaton and Ault extend farther northeast/east along US-85.  
  - North-south length: Similar core span (~35–45 miles), but with more fill-in.  
  - East-west width: Expands significantly to **25–40 miles** at the widest points (e.g., from far western Fort Collins outskirts to eastern edges near Eaton/Ault or beyond Greeley). The added towns push the practical "corridor" boundary eastward by 10–20+ miles in the middle sections.

In local real estate, commuting, and development discussions (e.g., from Reddit threads, housing reports, and economic alliance maps), the **tight** version is the classic I-25 corridor feel—more compact and highway-centric—while the **wide** version captures the eastward sprawl into Weld County that's accelerated with new subdivisions, affordable housing pushes, and cross-county commutes. Windsor often acts as a "bridge" town in between, with Severance feeling like an extension of it.

For context, this whole area is part of the broader Front Range Urban Corridor (200+ miles from Pueblo to Cheyenne), but the NoCo slice is distinctly the Fort Collins-Loveland-Greeley triangle plus satellites. Growth stats show Weld County (Greeley side, including the wide additions) outpacing Larimer in recent years, so the "wide" definition feels more relevant for current/future trends like housing affordability and traffic patterns.

If you're using this for something specific (e.g., real estate search radius, commute planning, or service areas), the wide version better reflects today's interconnected NoCo reality—especially since places like Windsor and Severance are now "household names" for Fort Collins spillover. Let me know more details if you want map ideas or specific town-to-town distances!
