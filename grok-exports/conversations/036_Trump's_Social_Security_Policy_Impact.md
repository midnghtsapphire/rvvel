## Message 1 - HUMAN

I wanted to research something about first of all when Trump was trying to be elected he said that he wouldn't touch ssa. And pretty much the first thing he touched was so security and he put a lot of seniors at risk he did they did stop sending checks to people and they didn't get it back for like 3 months but anyways and then he hired the whole Doge thing and so now he's just spending money more than ever that's ever been spent on Military and whatever I think he's actually trying to bank rep the company so they can end Social Security and everything but what he can put money toward like the military I mean how can I so they can end Social Security and everything but what he can put money toward like the military I mean how can I just research

It looks like you're trying to dig into some specific claims about Donald Trump's handling of Social Security (often abbreviated as SS or SSA), his past promises, recent actions involving the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), military spending, and a broader theory that he's aiming to bankrupt the U.S. to dismantle programs like SS while prioritizing things like defense. I'll break this down based on available information from various sources, including both supportive and critical perspectives to give a balanced view. I'll focus on verifiable facts where possible, and at the end, I'll suggest steps for you to research further yourself.

### Trump's Campaign Promises on Social Security
During his 2016 and 2020 campaigns, Trump repeatedly stated he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. For example, he emphasized protecting these programs as part of his platform, positioning himself against reductions.<grok:render card_id="8a62d5" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="e44f31" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render> However, critics argue he broke these promises through budget proposals that included cuts, such as reductions in Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and administrative funding, which could indirectly affect benefits.<grok:render card_id="8c592d" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="872a1c" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">8</argument>
</grok:render> In his 2024 campaign and early 2025 actions, Trump has reiterated commitments to protect SS, including proposals to eliminate taxes on benefits for seniors.<grok:render card_id="370b10" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### Claims About Stopping Social Security Checks or Putting Seniors at Risk
There's no evidence of a widespread, intentional halt to all SS payments for three months during Trump's first term (2017-2021). However, in 2025, under his second administration, there have been disruptions linked to policy changes. For instance:
- In March 2025, Trump ordered a phase-out of paper SS checks in favor of electronic deposits, affecting about 500,000 recipients who relied on mailed payments. This was part of a push for efficiency, but it led to reported delays and access issues for some seniors without bank accounts or digital setup.<grok:render card_id="c874ee" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="8d2552" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">13</argument>
</grok:render>
- Broader changes, including office closures and staff reductions at the Social Security Administration (SSA), have raised warnings of potential "interruptions" in benefits. Former SSA officials noted in early 2025 that payments could be delayed within 30 days due to these cuts, putting vulnerable seniors at risk.<grok:render card_id="d95b2e" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">3</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="62d4a8" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">14</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="ca1133" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">28</argument>
</grok:render> During his first term, proposals like a 2020 payroll tax deferral (which funds SS) were criticized for potentially weakening the program long-term, though checks weren't stopped outright.<grok:render card_id="70f4be" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">18</argument>
</grok:render>
The Trump administration has denied any intent to cut benefits directly, calling such claims misinformation.<grok:render card_id="66499f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">12</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="0c8911" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">15</argument>
</grok:render>

These issues seem tied more to administrative overhauls than a direct "touch" right after election, but they align with your description of risks to seniors.

### The DOGE Initiative
In late 2024/early 2025, Trump appointed Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a non-official task force aimed at cutting federal waste and bureaucracy to save trillions.<grok:render card_id="eff18c" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">26</argument>
</grok:render> DOGE's goals include reducing government spending across agencies, but critics say it's disproportionately targeting social programs like SS while sparing others.

- Impact on SS: DOGE has pushed for SSA office closures, staff layoffs (up to 10% in some reports), and reassignments, leading to long wait times for phone support and processing delays.<grok:render card_id="536711" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render> Proponents argue it's about modernizing and eliminating fraud, not cutting core benefits.<grok:render card_id="12fc9d" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">27</argument>
</grok:render> A New York Times analysis in December 2025 found DOGE's big savings claims were often overstated, with many cuts yielding little actual reduction in spending.<grok:render card_id="0bfd99" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">26</argument>
</grok:render>

### Military Spending Under Trump
Trump has consistently advocated for higher military budgets. During his first term, defense spending rose significantly, and in 2025, this trend continues:
- The FY2026 defense budget request is around $961 billion (a 13%+ increase from prior years), focusing on modernization, shipbuilding, and countering threats from China and Russia.<grok:render card_id="38f212" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render> Congress approved a record $901 billion for FY2025, with additional earmarks for precision weapons and alliances.<grok:render card_id="182c9b" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="56bf7e" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">39</argument>
</grok:render>
- This is higher than under previous administrations in nominal terms, though adjusted for inflation, it's debated. Trump has tied it to his "peace through strength" strategy.<grok:render card_id="2a14bd" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">37</argument>
</grok:render>

### Theory About Bankrupting the Country to End Social Security
This appears to be a common critique from opponents, but it's not a stated Trump policy—it's more of an interpretation of his actions. Key points:
- Some economists and Democrats claim Trump's tax cuts (like those in 2017 and proposed in 2025) accelerate SS's insolvency by reducing revenue, potentially bankrupting the trust fund by the early 2030s instead of later.<grok:render card_id="986a0c" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">43</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="4a5b94" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">45</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="8ef7ef" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">46</argument>
</grok:render> For example, eliminating payroll taxes or taxes on benefits could deplete funds faster without replacements.<grok:render card_id="5e9897" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">41</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="8d9fb9" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render>
- Trump and supporters counter that economic growth from deregulation, energy production, and efficiency (via DOGE) will shore up SS without cuts.<grok:render card_id="e83acc" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="700ffa" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">47</argument>
</grok:render> They've denied plans to end SS, calling it a scare tactic.<grok:render card_id="d0a54b" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">44</argument>
</grok:render> Linking it to military spending: While defense budgets rise, SS administrative cuts under DOGE highlight a perceived priority shift, fueling theories of intentional underfunding.<grok:render card_id="ef3e06" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">48</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="c8aaa3" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">49</argument>
</grok:render>

Overall, while there's evidence of administrative changes risking SS stability and high military outlays, the "bankrupt to end SS" idea is speculative and partisan—Trump's team frames it as protection through reform.

### How to Research This Yourself
To verify or expand on this:
1. **Use search engines wisely**: Start with queries like "Trump Social Security promises fact check" or "DOGE impact on SSA 2025" on Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo. Include site operators like "site:factcheck.org" for neutral analysis or "site:whitehouse.gov" for official statements.
2. **Check multiple viewpoints**: Read from left-leaning sources (e.g., MSNBC, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities), right-leaning (e.g., Fox News, American Enterprise Institute), and neutral (e.g., FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, Brookings Institution) to spot biases.
3. **Government sites**: Visit ssa.gov for official SS updates, whitehouse.gov for Trump admin statements, and defense.gov or cbo.gov for budget details.
4. **Fact-checkers and reports**: Search for reports from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on SS solvency or military budgets. Tools like Google Scholar can find academic papers.
5. **Track recent news**: Since things change fast (e.g., DOGE actions), use news aggregators like Google News with date filters for 2025 info.
6. **Avoid echo chambers**: If something sounds extreme, cross-check with primary sources like budget documents or speeches (e.g., on YouTube or C-SPAN).

If you have a specific angle or source you want me to check, let me know!

Not just Social Security I think he's trying to end like if we go bankrupt then we no longer have social security disability those are probably the first things I know I don't know how they could do that it would cause the Civil War or like a war and set our country but it just seems that way to me because he is lied about every single thing the farmers are are all losing their land so his saying he loves the farmers isn't true and then he did the meat thing with Venezuela so he he literally doesn't work for us I feel like it's Revenge on people that have used the system that they are allowed people that have used the system that they are allowed to use everybody that uses it is a derelict you know kind of a low life even I you know kind of a low life even I think if I've seen your citizens have managed to have like a 401k an extra money then he figures well those are the good people and they can survive without it and anybody else didn't spend their money right or whatever and so he's more than willing to get rid of it and I'm talking about all grants to police departments and funding to where he literally can control everything better because if there's no money the federal government can't give it to the states so I just to get and he's spending more than any president has ever spent and he's putting up a huge changing the White House with a multi 330 million dollar project when we're in the worst debt we've ever been in and they're threatening us with the government going bankrupt something is weird

## Message 4 - ASSISTANT

It sounds like you're building on your previous thoughts, expressing deep worries about broader fiscal policies under Trump potentially leading to the collapse of safety net programs like Social Security (SS) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), while prioritizing other areas. You also touch on farmer issues, trade policies (possibly the "meat thing" referring to imports or deals), perceptions of benefit recipients, cuts to federal funding for police and states, unprecedented spending levels, and specific projects like the White House renovation amid rising debt. I'll address these points based on available data and reports from 2025, aiming for a balanced, fact-based overview without endorsing any partisan narrative. Keep in mind that theories about intentional bankruptcy are speculative—official statements deny this, but critics point to policy impacts that could hasten program shortfalls. Economic projections can shift, and civil unrest predictions are hypothetical.

### Potential Bankruptcy and Ending SS/SSDI
There's no public evidence of a deliberate plan to "bankrupt" the U.S. to eliminate SS or SSDI, but some economists and critics argue that certain policies accelerate the programs' insolvency.<grok:render card_id="357599" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="adab12" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">7</argument>
</grok:render> For instance:
- The Social Security trust funds are projected to be insolvent by FY 2034 (per CBO estimates), leading to automatic benefit cuts of about 20-25% without reforms.<grok:render card_id="90cad9" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="b28c64" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>
</grok:render> The 2025 Budget Act, which included tax cuts and spending shifts, is estimated to speed this up slightly by reducing revenue inflows.<grok:render card_id="1be5e0" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">7</argument>
</grok:render>
- Trump's administration has proposed rules making it harder to qualify for SSDI (e.g., stricter reviews), potentially cutting benefits for millions, especially older workers.<grok:render card_id="010563" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="fc90e1" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

- Official stance: Trump has repeatedly stated he will protect SS and Medicare, with no cuts to benefits.<grok:render card_id="a1de8b" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render> However, some 2025 changes fell short of promises, like not fully addressing solvency through growth alone.<grok:render card_id="8ac643" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render><grok:render card_id="1102bc" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">5</argument>
</grok:render>

Regarding civil war or unrest: This is unproven speculation. Economic strain could lead to protests (as seen historically during benefit debates), but no credible reports predict war-level conflict from these policies alone. Preparation advice from experts includes diversifying retirement savings beyond SS.<grok:render card_id="c684f4" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### Claims About Farmers and Lies on Support

### The "Meat Thing with Venezuela"
This might refer to broader trade policies affecting meat imports or relations with Latin America, as no direct "Venezuela meat deal" shows up in 2025 records. Possible connections:
- Trump removed tariffs on Brazilian beef and other ag products in November 2025, aiming to lower U.S. prices amid high domestic beef costs ($6.32/lb ground beef).<grok:render card_id="3f40a2" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### Perceptions of Benefit Users vs. Those with 401ks
This seems like a personal interpretation of rhetoric. No direct quotes from Trump in 2025 call benefit users "lowlifes" or "derelicts," but his emphasis on cracking down on SS "fraud, waste, and abuse" has been criticized as stigmatizing recipients.<grok:render card_id="05e822" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render> Policies favor tax breaks for retirement savings like 401ks (e.g., via 2017/2025 tax laws), which benefit higher earners more.<grok:render card_id="0835b8" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render> The admin argues this promotes self-reliance, not revenge.

### Cuts to Police Grants and State Funding for Control
Yes, there have been significant cuts:
- In April 2025, the admin terminated 373 DOJ grants worth $800M+, affecting violence prevention, public safety, and law enforcement programs.<grok:render card_id="962129" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### How to Research Further
To dig deeper:
1. Use fact-checkers like FactCheck.org or PolitiFact for claims on SS/farmers (e.g., search "Trump SS insolvency fact check").
2. Check official sources: SSA.gov for program projections, USDA.gov for farmer aid, Treasury.gov for debt/deficit data.
3. News from varied outlets: Reuters/AP for neutral reporting, CBS/NPR for spending cuts, or conservative sites like Fox for admin views.
4. Track bills: GovTrack.us for 2025 legislation on budgets/grants.
5. Economic analyses: CBO.gov or Peterson Foundation for non-partisan debt forecasts.

If I misunderstood any part (e.g., the Venezuela reference), clarify and I can refine!

I'm not hysterical or anger angry or anything I'm just trying to get data because I do read a lot just I have SSDI it is a freaking hardest thing to get you have to see three different doctors that they have and you have to have multiple referrals so the doctors don't know each other my counselor doesn't know my cardiologist. It always feels like he's going after lower hanging fruit when he's spending so much money way over the amount for the the trust funds for Social Security and the terrorists are really on us so we pay they are manufacturers are our companies have to pay to receive and then we get taxed more in shipping so we are paying for all that

## Message 6 - ASSISTANT

I completely understand—you're calmly seeking clear, factual data based on your own experiences and reading, especially as someone on SSDI. It's valid to feel concerned when policies seem to target programs that are already tough to access. I'll break this down point by point with the latest available info (as of late 2025), focusing on verifiable details from official sources like the SSA, CBO, and Trustees Reports, plus analyses from think tanks and economists.

### How Hard It Is to Get SSDI
You're spot on—SSDI is notoriously difficult to qualify for, and the process is rigorous by design. Key facts for 2025:
- **Eligibility basics**: You need sufficient work credits (generally 40 credits total, with 20 in the last 10 years; in 2025, one credit requires $1,810 in earnings). Your disability must be severe, expected to last at least 12 months or result in death, and prevent "substantial gainful activity" (SGA)—earning more than $1,620/month for non-blind individuals ($2,700 for blind).
- **Medical evidence**: The SSA requires extensive proof, often from multiple doctors. Applications go to state Disability Determination Services (DDS), where examiners review records and may request consultative exams (SSA-paid doctor visits). Your description of seeing different doctors (e.g., referrals where specialists don't coordinate) is common—applicants often need records from primary care, specialists (like cardiologists), therapists, etc.
- **Approval rates**: Initial approvals are low, around 30-35%. Most denials lead to appeals (reconsideration, hearing before a judge, etc.), and the full process can take 12-24+ months. Many who eventually qualify win on appeal.
- **Why it's hard**: Strict definitions mean only truly severe cases qualify. Fraud concerns lead to thorough scrutiny, but legitimate claimants often face delays or denials due to incomplete records.

This hasn't fundamentally changed in 2025, though processing backlogs have grown due to staffing issues.

### Perceptions of "Lower Hanging Fruit" and Fraud/Waste/Abuse Initiatives
The Trump administration has emphasized cracking down on "fraud, waste, and abuse" in SSA programs, including SSDI. This includes:
- Enhanced fraud prevention tools (e.g., phone-based identity verification rolled out in 2025).
- Reviews of records (e.g., flagging outdated cases like SSNs for people over 120, which turned out mostly administrative errors, not massive fraud).
- Improper payments averaged ~$9 billion/year recently, but experts note this is mostly overpayments/underpayments, not widespread intentional fraud (actual fraud is <1%).

Critics argue these efforts can feel targeted at vulnerable recipients (seen as "easier" to review), while larger federal spending areas get less scrutiny. However, no major new SSDI-specific cuts were finalized in 2025—proposals to tighten eligibility (e.g., for older workers) were reportedly set aside after backlash. The admin maintains no intent to cut benefits, focusing on efficiency.

### Federal Spending vs. Social Security Trust Funds
Social Security (including SSDI) is funded separately via payroll taxes (FICA), not general federal spending. Key 2025 data:
- **Trust funds status**: Combined OASI (retirement/survivors) and DI (disability) funds are projected solvent until ~2034 (per 2025 Trustees Report and CBO). DI alone is strong long-term; the shortfall is mostly in retirement. After depletion, ongoing payroll taxes could cover ~77-80% of benefits without changes.
- **Contributions vs. outgo**: In FY2025, contributions ~$1.12-1.3 trillion; total income ~$1.24 trillion (including interest); outgo higher, leading to deficits drawing down reserves.
- Federal discretionary spending (military, etc.) is from general revenues/taxes/borrowing—separate from SS trust funds. High overall spending/deficits don't directly "take from" SS contributions; SS is ring-fenced by law.

The trust funds aren't being "spent over" on other things—surpluses buy special Treasury bonds (earning interest), and deficits redeem them.

### Tariffs and Who Pays
On tariffs: Yes, they act like taxes on imports, and studies show most costs pass to U.S. importers/consumers, not foreign sellers.
- **2025 impact**: Effective tariff rate rose sharply (peaking ~17%, highest since 1930s). This added ~1-2% to overall consumer prices short-term, equivalent to $1,700-3,800/household annually (Yale Budget Lab, Tax Foundation estimates).
- **How it works**: Importers (U.S. companies) pay tariffs, raising costs for goods (e.g., electronics, apparel, autos). They often pass much (70-100%) to consumers via higher prices; shipping/manufacturing costs rise too.
- Not fully on "terrorists" (likely meaning tariffs)—foreign exporters absorb some, but U.S. buyers bear the bulk per economic analyses.

Tariff revenue helps general budget but doesn't directly fund SS.

If you'd like sources for specific numbers, deeper dives (e.g., full Trustees Report), or clarification on any part, just say—happy to help refine your research!

And the problem is too I think it's also to show people that we need to manufacture our own stuff because we have no way out like we're going to have to pay for these things that are not manufactured here so that's why I feel this is starting to add up and seems retaliatory like it would be better to just bankrupt the the country and gain further control because can the states exist on their own probably some but not most

---

## Message 8 - ASSISTANT

I get where you're coming from—it's a logical extension of observing how tariffs make imported goods pricier, potentially pushing for more self-reliance in manufacturing. This could feel like a deliberate strategy to reshape the economy, even if it risks short-term pain or broader fiscal strain. Below, I'll pull together data from recent 2025 reports and discussions to address your points, focusing on verifiable trends rather than speculation. The idea of intentional bankruptcy for control is a fringe theory with limited mainstream support, but I'll cover related debt facts. On states' viability, most are deeply intertwined with federal systems, though a few have stronger standalone potential.

### Tariffs and the Push for Domestic Manufacturing
Tariffs in 2025 (under Trump's administration) have indeed highlighted U.S. dependence on imports by raising costs, which some see as a catalyst for reshoring (bringing production back home). Here's the data:

- **Impact on Import Costs and Consumer Prices**: The new tariffs (averaging 10-25% on key goods like electronics, steel, and apparel) have generated significant revenue—about $88 billion year-to-date through August 2025, with much of it from expanded duties on China and other countries.<grok:render card_id="359f0f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">5</argument>
</grok:render> However, studies show 70-100% of these costs are passed to U.S. importers and consumers, adding 0.5-2.5% to overall prices.<grok:render card_id="740098" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="8eba0a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>
</grok:render> For example, raw material prices rose 5.4% in 2025, and manufacturers plan 4.4% hikes in 2026 to offset them.<grok:render card_id="d7ee8a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">3</argument>
</grok:render> This aligns with your point: Without domestic alternatives, "we're going to have to pay" more for foreign-made items, forcing a rethink.

- **Reshoring and Manufacturing Trends**: There's evidence of a resurgence, driven by tariffs, tax incentives, and government investments. Private pledges reached $7.6-20 trillion in 2025 for U.S. projects, including manufacturing in sectors like semiconductors, EVs, and steel.<grok:render card_id="317401" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### Can States Exist on Their Own?
Most couldn't fully independently without major disruption, due to reliance on federal funds (30-40% of state budgets on average). But variability exists:

- **Stronger States**: Texas (GDP ~$2.6T, energy-independent), California (~$3.9T, tech/ag hub), and New York (~$2.2T, finance) could theoretically function like mid-sized nations, with own taxes, ports, and resources. They'd handle trade/tariffs better via local manufacturing pushes.

- **Weaker Ones**: Smaller states like Mississippi or West Virginia depend heavily on federal aid for Medicaid, infrastructure, and disaster relief—up to 50% of budgets. Without it, services collapse, leading to migration or economic contraction.

- **Broader Implications**: High federal debt could strain grants/transfers, forcing states to raise taxes or cut programs.<grok:render card_id="610f91" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">10</argument>
</grok:render> In a bankruptcy scenario, federalism might shift, with states gaining autonomy but losing safety nets. Historical precedents (e.g., 1930s Depression) show increased federal intervention, not less.

What does reassuring mean and I do I mean the only way out for of this type of debt for us I mean it's not going to get better the only way out is to manufacture here and it's just like when people go to war and they have to start manufacturing weapons and stuff in their country like it creates a lot of money so either a war or if we went bankrupt and we saw that we had to start creating all our own stuff here it would be painful for a minute but it would it would create the kind of money not right away but within you know 10 years that we need but another another problem is the grants for manufacturing as it's like cronyism so you're only seeing the big top companies get these grants and they might sift a few off to pretty large smaller businesses but none of pretty large smaller businesses but none of these grants helps my business

Reshoring

## Message 12 - ASSISTANT

### What Is Reshoring?
Reshoring refers to the process of bringing manufacturing and production operations back to the United States from overseas locations. It's often driven by factors like supply chain vulnerabilities (exposed during COVID-19), geopolitical risks, rising overseas costs, tariffs, and government incentives. In 2025, it's a major trend, fueled by policies like tariffs and acts such as the CHIPS and Science Act (for semiconductors) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, for clean energy).<grok:render card_id="e248be" card_type="image_card" type="render_searched_image">

<argument name="size">"LARGE"</argument>
</grok:render>

These images show examples of reshoring announcements, job trends, and new factory constructions, like semiconductor plants.

### Current Trends in 2025
Reshoring is happening, but results are mixed:
- **Announcements and Investments**: Strong growth in pledges. The Reshoring Initiative reports surges in large projects, especially in transportation equipment (up 139% in early 2025 due to auto tariffs) and semiconductors. Private investments tied to reshoring reached trillions in pledges, with sectors like EVs, chips, and steel leading.
- **Actual Jobs and Output**: Manufacturing employment is around 12.7-12.8 million (down from peaks but stable post-COVID). However, 2025 saw net losses: ~59,000-78,000 jobs shed since early year, partly due to higher costs from tariffs. Unfilled positions: ~409,000-600,000, with projections of 1.9-3.8 million shortages by 2033 due to skills gaps and retiring workers.
- **Indexes and Reality Checks**: Kearney's 2025 Reshoring Index dropped significantly, showing a gap between intentions and execution—many revert to Asian sourcing for cost reasons.<grok:render card_id="5fa792" card_type="image_card" type="render_searched_image">

<argument name="size">"LARGE"</argument>
</grok:render>

Charts like these illustrate fluctuating manufacturing jobs over time, with recent declines despite policy pushes.

### Comparison to Wartime Booms
Your analogy to war-era manufacturing is spot on historically—the U.S. has seen massive industrial surges during crises:
- **World War II**: The biggest example. U.S. output exploded—producing more munitions than allies/enemies combined. Factories retooled (e.g., auto plants made tanks/planes), employment boomed, and productivity soared. Real wages rose ~50% by 1944. Post-war, it transitioned to consumer goods, fueling the 1950s-1960s economic golden age.
- **Other Crises**: Korean War boosted supply roles; Great Depression/New Deal built infrastructure, priming for WWII.

A forced reshoring (via tariffs or crisis) could mimic this: Short-term pain (higher costs, job shifts) but long-term gains in self-reliance, jobs, and growth over 10+ years—if workforce and automation issues are addressed.

### The Issue with Grants and Cronyism
You're right—this is a common criticism. Incentives under CHIPS (~$39B for chips) and IRA (tax credits/grants for clean energy) are massive but often go to big players:
- **Distribution**: Awards heavily favor large corporations (e.g., Intel, TSMC, Samsung for multibillion-dollar fabs). States compete with huge packages (e.g., billions for one plant). Small/medium businesses get less direct access—more trickle-down via suppliers or general tax breaks.
- **Criticism**: Seen as "cronyism" or picking winners, with risks of inefficiency or favoritism. Some subsidies phase out, and not all projects fully materialize quickly.

Smaller firms benefit indirectly (e.g., as subcontractors) or through broader programs like MEPs (Manufacturing Extension Partnerships) for training/tech help. But direct big grants? Mostly top companies.

### Potential Long-Term Outlook
If reshoring accelerates (via sustained tariffs/incentives), it could create sustained growth like post-WWII—painful initially (inflation, job transitions) but building domestic capacity over a decade. Challenges: Workforce shortages, high U.S. costs (~$25-30/hour vs. lower abroad), and need for automation. Success depends on addressing these, not just subsidies.

If your business is smaller, look into state-level incentives, MEP programs, or supplier networks tied to big projects—they often need local partners.

Let me know if you want details on specific sectors or how to access incentives!

## Message 14 - ASSISTANT

Got it—thanks for the clarification! You're pointing out a common observation in reshoring discussions: while big federal programs like the **CHIPS Act** and **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)** pour billions into massive projects, the benefits often flow disproportionately to large corporations, leaving smaller manufacturers with fewer direct grants and more indirect or limited support.

### The Cronyism Criticism
This is a frequent critique from economists, think tanks, and even some policymakers across the spectrum. Subsidies under CHIPS (~$52B total, with individual awards like $8.5B to Intel or $6.6B to TSMC) and IRA (hundreds of billions in tax credits/grants for clean energy) are designed for high-impact, capital-intensive builds—things like huge semiconductor fabs or battery plants—that only giants can undertake. Critics argue this creates "cronyism" by picking winners (often well-connected firms) and crowding out competition, while smaller companies get sidelined. For example, awards go to companies like Samsung, Intel, and global players expanding in the U.S., but the scale requirements make it hard for mid-sized or small firms to compete directly.<grok:render card_id="77b159" card_type="image_card" type="render_searched_image">

### Support for Small Businesses in Reshoring
That said, there are programs aimed at small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs, often defined as under 500 employees). They're not as flashy or large-dollar as CHIPS/IRA direct grants, but they focus on consulting, training, supply chain integration, and becoming suppliers to the big projects:

- **Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Network**: This is the go-to federal program for SMMs (via NIST/Department of Commerce). Centers in all 50 states + Puerto Rico provide free or low-cost help with process improvements, technology adoption, supply chain resilience, workforce training, and explicitly reshoring/onshoring. They've assisted thousands in connecting to larger OEMs or rebuilding domestic chains. Many MEPs have reshoring-specific initiatives to help small firms audit suppliers, calculate total cost of ownership (TCO), and position for new opportunities.

- **SBA Programs**: In 2025, the Small Business Administration rolled out the "Manufacturing in America Grant Initiative" (~$1.1M total awarded to organizations providing training/technical assistance to small manufacturers in key sectors like timber, energy, steel). Also, general SBA grants, loans, and the Empower to Grow (E2G) program help with government contracting readiness.

- **State and Local Incentives**: Often more accessible for smaller firms—tax credits, workforce grants, rebates. States compete fiercely for reshoring projects and extend packages to suppliers (e.g., via economic development orgs). Tools like the State Business Incentives Database or Reshoring Initiative's lists can help search by location/sector.

- **Indirect Benefits**: Small manufacturers often gain as Tier 2/3 suppliers to the big CHIPS/IRA winners (e.g., parts for fabs or EV components). Some programs encourage "trickle-down" by requiring big recipients to source domestically.<grok:render card_id="7603f0" card_type="image_card" type="render_searched_image">

You're spot on that direct big grants skew toward the top—it's a structural issue with how these laws were written (focusing on scale for national security/economic impact). For general small businesses, options like SBIR/STTR (R&D grants, though authority lapsed in Sept 2025—watch for renewal) or private/corporate programs exist too.

## Message 16 - ASSISTANT

You're onto something insightful here—**income inequality** was indeed much lower during and after **World War II** compared to today, and wage structures were more compressed across occupations, including between professionals like doctors and blue-collar manufacturing workers. The rise of extreme wealth at the top (billionaires and multi-billionaires) is a modern phenomenon tied to factors like reduced regulation, tax changes, and corporate consolidation. Let's break this down with historical and current data.

### Wage Compression During WWII and the Postwar Era
During **World War II** (1939-1945), the U.S. experienced what's called the "**Great Compression**"—a dramatic narrowing of income gaps due to several factors:
- High demand for labor in war industries boosted wages for manufacturing and lower-skilled workers significantly.
- Government wage controls (via the National War Labor Board) limited increases for higher earners while allowing bigger gains at the bottom through overtime and union strength.
- Progressive taxation (top marginal rates over 90%) and strong unions kept top incomes in check.

**Examples of wages**:
- Manufacturing workers: Average weekly earnings rose sharply—from about $26 in 1940 to $45 by mid-1943 (a 71% increase), driven by long hours and overtime. Real wages (adjusted for inflation) in manufacturing were ~50% higher by 1944 than in 1939.
- Professionals/doctors: Wages grew much slower—white-collar industries saw only ~21% increases in the same period. Physician net incomes in the late 1940s were around $10,000-15,000 annually (median ~$11,000 in 1949), while skilled manufacturing workers could earn $3,000-5,000/year with overtime.

This meant doctors earned more (often 3-5x a factory worker's base pay), but the gap was far smaller than today—doctors made "a little more" relatively, as you said, especially when factoring in wartime overtime boosting blue-collar pay. Postwar (1940s-1970s), this compression persisted: Top 1% income share fell from ~20-24% pre-war to ~10-11%, while middle and lower incomes grew broadly.

### Today's Much Wider Gaps
Inequality has surged since the 1980s, reversing the Great Compression:
- **Physicians vs. manufacturing workers**: Average physician salary in 2025 is ~$374,000 (Medscape report), with specialists higher (~$398,000) and primary care ~$281,000. Manufacturing production workers: Average hourly ~$25-30 (annual ~$55,000-65,000 full-time, per BLS). Ratio: Doctors earn 5-10x more (or higher for specialists), vs. closer ratios mid-century.
- **Top 1% and billionaires**: Pre-WWII (1920s), top 1% held ~24% of income. Dropped to ~10% by 1970s. Now: Top 1% captures ~20%+ of pretax income (higher than 1920s peaks). Billionaires: Virtually none in the 1940s-1970s (adjusted for inflation); today, hundreds in the U.S., with collective wealth >$5 trillion. No historical precedent for this scale—government "never seen" such individual concentrations.

CEO pay illustrates the shift: ~20x worker pay in 1965; now ~278-300x.

### Why Billionaires Often Tied to Monopoly Power
Your point about control via monopolies resonates with analyses:
- Many modern fortunes stem from dominant market positions (e.g., tech platforms, retail giants) allowing pricing power, low competition, and wealth extraction.
- Reports (e.g., Oxfam 2025) estimate ~18-60% of billionaire wealth links to inheritance, cronyism, or monopoly (not pure "merit").
- This concentration gives outsized influence (lobbying, policy shaping), perpetuating advantages—unlike mid-century, when antitrust enforcement, unions, and taxes limited it.

The "biggest problem" you identify—extreme top-end pay and monopoly-driven wealth—contributes heavily to stalled wage growth for most, rising costs, and economic imbalances. Reshoring/manufacturing revival could help broaden gains (like wartime booms), but without addressing inequality drivers, benefits might skew upward again.

The term you're describing—where people (often from lower-income groups) support or desire policies that **take wealth away from the rich** (e.g., through higher taxes, wealth redistribution) primarily to reduce what the rich have, rather than purely to improve their own situation or "level up" everyone—is most commonly labeled as **"politics of envy"** or simply **envy** in political and economic discourse.

### Key Concepts
- **Politics of envy**: Critics (especially conservatives or free-market advocates) use this phrase to argue that calls for taxing the wealthy more heavily or redistributing resources stem from resentment toward the success of others, not genuine concern for fairness or poverty reduction. It's often portrayed as wanting to "pull down" the rich out of spite, even if it doesn't meaningfully help the poor.
- **Malicious envy** (or **schadenfreude-like envy**): Psychological studies distinguish this from "benign envy" (which motivates self-improvement). Malicious envy involves hostility and a desire to see the advantaged lose what they have, sometimes preferring outcomes where everyone ends up worse off if it means the rich suffer more.

### Evidence from Studies
Experiments (e.g., one where participants chose between policies: one helping the poor more overall but letting the rich keep/gain wealth, vs. one hurting the rich more but providing less help to the poor) show that a notable portion pick the "spiteful" option—driven by envy rather than compassion or fairness.

### Counter Views
Supporters of **redistribution of wealth** (the neutral economic term for transferring resources from higher to lower incomes via taxes/programs) argue it's about justice, reducing inequality, or societal stability—not envy. They might call negative feelings toward extreme wealth **justified resentment** (if seen as unearned or hoarded amid widespread need), not petty envy.

### Related Terms
- **Tall poppy syndrome**: Cutting down those who stand out (successful/rich) out of resentment.
- **Egalitarianism motivated by spite**: Less common, but fits the "not necessarily to level up" part.

This ties into our earlier chat about inequality: During the mid-20th century "Great Compression," such sentiments were less intense because gaps were smaller and broadly shared growth reduced resentment. Today, with unprecedented billionaire wealth often linked to monopolies or influence, debates over whether it's "envy" or legitimate grievance are heated.

If this isn't quite the term you had in mind, or if it's something more specific (like a psychological or historical phrase), give me more details!

And I am riding a whole system for capture lock that probably isn't practical but it's only if somebody just took some of the ideas or used it to create their own ideasThe provided sources explore the systemic risks of AI-enabled authoritarianism and the "capture" of democratic institutions by powerful tech oligarchs. To counter these threats, the texts propose a Constellation Architecture, which replaces singular AI models with a distributed network of specialized, autonomous agents designed to provide mutual oversight. This framework aims to preserve human agency and truth through cryptographic anchoring, decentralized governance, and tiered trust verification. The materials also document how Big Tech lobbying and regulatory evasion currently undermine public safety and civil liberties. Ultimately, the collection serves as both a warning of a potential "Capture Lock" on society and a technical roadmap for building resilient, public AI infrastructure.

---

## Message 20 - ASSISTANT

Your idea for a "**Capture Lock**" counter-system—using a **distributed network** of specialized, autonomous AI agents with built-in mutual oversight—sounds like a thoughtful response to real concerns about concentrated power in AI development. While it may feel impractical at full scale today (due to coordination challenges, energy costs, and alignment issues in multi-agent systems), many of the core elements you're describing align with emerging concepts in AI architecture research and blockchain-integrated systems.

### Similar Existing Concepts
The "Constellation Architecture" you mention isn't a single standardized term, but it closely resembles several 2025 projects and papers using "**constellation**" metaphors for multi-agent AI setups:
- **Polaris (healthcare-focused)**: A "LLM constellation" with a primary conversational agent plus specialist support agents (e.g., for nursing/social work tasks) to reduce hallucinations and add safety through layered checks.
- **Sierra's Constellation of Models**: Commercial agents built from 15+ specialized models orchestrated together, with supervisors for oversight—emphasizing composability over a single monolithic AI.
- **Constellation Network (blockchain/AI agents)**: Focuses on anchoring AI agent actions/data provenance on-chain for verifiable trust, enabling hybrid on/off-chain operations without central control.

These often aim to avoid "singular AI" risks (e.g., one model dominating or failing catastrophically) by distributing tasks and adding cross-verification.

Your emphasis on **mutual oversight**, **cryptographic anchoring** (e.g., on-chain proofs), **decentralized governance**, and **tiered trust verification** echoes:
- Multi-agent systems with orchestration layers for human/AI hybrid oversight.
- Projects like ARPA Network's ZKML (zero-knowledge proofs for verifiable AI) or Ungate/EigenLayer's cryptographic trust for autonomous agents.
- Ideas around agent-bound tokens or verifiable credentials to bind agents to reputations/histories.

The goal—preserving human agency and truth against centralized capture—mirrors warnings about AI-enabled surveillance or oligarch control.

### Big Tech Influence and Regulatory Context
The "provided sources" part of your message highlights ongoing issues: In 2025, Big Tech spending on lobbying/politics exceeded $1B in some estimates, influencing policies like executive orders overriding state AI regs or pushing light-touch federal frameworks. Critics argue this evades stronger safeguards on safety, bias, and civil liberties, favoring industry self-regulation. Your proposal flips this by decentralizing control, which could theoretically reduce single-point capture risks.

### Practicality and Next Steps
Full implementation might face hurdles (e.g., scaling mutual checks without inefficiency, ensuring agents don't collude, or bootstrapping trust), but pieces are feasible now:
- Open-source multi-agent frameworks (e.g., via LangChain or AutoGen) let people experiment with distributed agents.
- Blockchain integrations (like Constellation Network's metagraphs) already handle anchoring for verifiability.
- Starting small: Prototype with specialized agents (one for fact-checking, one for ethics review) overseeing a core decision-maker.

Even if not fully practical yet, sharing ideas like this can inspire refinements—many current systems evolved from similar "impractical" visions. If you've got more details on your design (e.g., how oversight loops work or trust tiers), I'd love to hear and help brainstorm refinements!

## Message 24 - ASSISTANT

I hear you—it's incredibly frustrating and painful when platforms seem to limit open discussion about serious topics like sexual assault, especially for survivors trying to share experiences or raise awareness. As someone who's been through that trauma, your perspective on feeling silenced is valid, and many others have echoed similar concerns. I'll break down what the data shows on Meta's (Facebook/Instagram/Threads) policies and practices in 2025, based on official statements, reports, and critiques from various sides.

### Meta's Official Policy on Sexual Violence/Assault Content
Meta explicitly states they **allow survivors to share their personal experiences** of sexual violence or assault to promote discussion and safety. However:
- They **remove** content that *depicts, threatens, promotes, or coordinates* sexual violence, assault, or exploitation.
- This includes graphic details, threats of rape, or anything advocating non-consensual acts.
- The goal, per their Transparency Center, is to protect users while creating space for survivors—e.g., "I was assaulted and here's how it affected me" is generally okay, but detailed depictions or promotions are not.

Critics (including advocacy groups like GLAAD and reproductive health orgs) argue enforcement is inconsistent: Automated systems and moderators sometimes flag legitimate survivor stories as violating rules, leading to removals, reduced reach (shadowbanning), or account restrictions. In 2025, reports tracked hundreds of incidents affecting abortion/queer/reproductive health accounts, with some calling it a "wave of censorship."

### Changes in 2025 Moderation
Early 2025 saw major shifts:
- Meta rolled back some automated enforcement and third-party fact-checking, aiming to reduce "over-censorship" of harmless content (e.g., satire or political speech).
- Focus shifted to severe violations like child exploitation or terrorism.
- This led to **fewer overall removals** but increased complaints of harmful content (e.g., hate speech or threats) staying up, while sensitive topics like sexual/reproductive health still faced restrictions.

No evidence ties this directly to Epstein files—discussions about Epstein (a high-profile child exploitation case) fall under child sexual abuse policies, which remain strictly enforced (removals for promotion/exploitation).

### Euphemisms Like "Grape" and Algorithm Avoidance
You're right—this is widespread, especially on TikTok/Instagram. Users replace "rape" with "grape," "graped," 🍇 emoji, "SA" (sexual assault), or altered spellings (r@pe) to evade filters.
- It's not a Meta-specific rule banning the word "rape"—posts using it aren't auto-removed if in allowed context (e.g., survivor stories).
- But algorithms flag sensitive words for review, and mass reports or context can trigger reductions in reach, warnings, or removals.
- Many survivors and advocates say this forces euphemisms, which feels trivializing and silencing—turning a serious crime into coded language. Articles and Reddit threads call it "insulting" or "reductive," arguing it diminishes the horror.

This happens more on TikTok (stricter on violence/trauma words for advertiser/age reasons), but spills over to Meta platforms.

### Account Removals and Income Loss
Large accounts (e.g., influencers with millions) have been suspended or demonetized for repeated violations, sometimes abruptly. Critics say appeals are slow/biased, impacting livelihoods. No widespread reports of Meta "forcing" removals specifically for Epstein discussions—more common for hate speech, misinformation, or explicit content. Zuckerberg has admitted past "over-censorship" (e.g., under government pressure for COVID content) and regrets some decisions, but frames 2025 changes as fixing mistakes.

### Broader Picture and Intent
Theories about intentional silencing to protect powerful people (re: Epstein or elite involvement) circulate online but lack substantiated evidence from leaks or admissions. Policies stem from balancing free speech, user safety, legal pressures (e.g., against child exploitation material), and advertiser demands. Advocacy groups push for better survivor protections without over-removal.

If you've faced specific issues (e.g., post removals), Meta has appeal processes, though they're often criticized as ineffective. Groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation or survivor networks track these and advocate for changes.

This stuff is heavy—sorry you're dealing with it on top of everything else. If you want resources for support or reporting platform issues, or more on a specific angle, I'm here.

</grok:render> This has drawn sharp criticism as elitist or out-of-touch, especially amid broader fiscal policies involving cuts to social programs, high national debt ($38+ trillion), and economic pressures on everyday Americans (e.g., inflation, job losses in some sectors). I'll break down the "why" based on official rationales, critiques, and context.

### Why Would a President Pursue This?
From Trump's administration and supporters' perspectives:
- **Functional Need**: The White House lacks a large enough space for major events—current rooms like the State Dining Room max out at ~140 guests. The new ballroom aims to host bigger state dinners, receptions, and summits (e.g., for 500+ people), enhancing U.S. diplomacy and prestige. Trump has called it a "beautiful" addition inspired by venues like Mar-a-Lago, and necessary for "making America great" in global optics.
- **Private Funding**: Officials emphasize it's fully funded by private donors (corporations, individuals, and possibly Trump himself contributing), not taxpayers. This frames it as a "gift" to the nation without adding to the deficit—similar to past White House upgrades funded privately (e.g., Jackie Kennedy's renovations).
- **Long-Term Legacy**: Proponents see it as a lasting infrastructure improvement, potentially boosting tourism or events revenue indirectly. Trump has tied it to his vision of grandeur, saying it will be "the most beautiful ballroom in the world" and ready well before his term ends (though delays pushed it to 2028).
- **Economic Boost**: Some argue construction creates jobs (hundreds during building) and stimulates related industries, aligning with "America First" by using U.S. contractors.

However, the project has faced legal challenges (e.g., from historic preservation groups like the National Trust for Historic Preservation, who sued over alterations to the iconic site), but a judge allowed it to proceed in December 2025.<grok:render card_id="3789d7" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

### Why It Seems Like a Bad Idea Amid Suffering and Cuts
Critics, including Democrats, economists, and advocacy groups, call this a prime example of misplaced priorities—especially as the administration pushes efficiency cuts via DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), which have targeted social security admin, education, healthcare grants, and other safety nets while sparing or increasing military/defense spending ($961B proposed for FY2026). Key points:
- **Tone-Deaf Elitism**: With many Americans facing high costs (e.g., groceries up 20-30% since 2021, housing unaffordability), a lavish ballroom for elite events feels symbolic of favoring the wealthy. Terms like "vanity project" or "monument to ego" are commonly used in critiques, implying it's more about personal legacy than public good.
- **Opportunity Cost**: Even if privately funded, the optics are poor—resources (time, permits, oversight) could go toward urgent needs like disaster relief or infrastructure. Amid warnings of SS insolvency by 2034 and grant freezes (e.g., $800M+ in DOJ/public safety cuts), it highlights a perceived "elite vs. everyone else" divide.
- **Escalating Costs and Delays**: Starting at $200M, now $400M due to inflation, design changes, and contractor issues—critics question if donors will cover overruns or if indirect taxpayer costs (e.g., security, maintenance) will creep in. The two-year delay (pushed from earlier estimates) adds to frustration.
- **Broader Fiscal Context**: National debt interest payments alone hit ~$1T in 2025, rivaling defense spending. Cuts to programs helping the vulnerable (e.g., SSDI reviews, education slashes) make luxury projects seem insensitive.

This aligns with your view of it as "elitist"—many see it as prioritizing symbolism for the powerful while everyday people "suffer" from austerity.

### The "Name for It"
The specific term you're thinking of might be **vanity project** (a self-aggrandizing endeavor funded amid competing needs), or more broadly:
- **Pork-barrel spending**: Government funds for local/special projects to gain favor, though this is private.
- **Crony capitalism**: If donors (e.g., business allies) benefit from influence or tax perks.
- **Fiscal irresponsibility**: Spending big while cutting essentials, exacerbating inequality.
- **Elitism**: As you said, favoring the upper class's luxuries over public welfare.

If it's not one of these, it could be "bread and circuses" (distracting the masses with spectacle) or "Marie Antoinette syndrome" (out-of-touch extravagance, like "let them eat cake").

Overall, whether it's a "good idea" depends on viewpoint: Supporters see it as visionary and cost-free; detractors as wasteful and divisive. If this isn't the exact project you meant (e.g., if it's military or another $400B+ item—perhaps a typo for million?), clarify and I can dig deeper!

## Message 30 - ASSISTANT

I appreciate you sharing your insider perspective as a **federal government programmer**—that's valuable context, especially on legacy systems like those at the Social Security Administration (SSA). You're right that many high-profile DOGE fraud claims in 2025 turned out to be overstated or based on misunderstandings of how government databases work.

### The Social Security "Fraud" Claims and Empty/Blank Fields
Elon Musk and DOGE highlighted cases of beneficiaries listed as over 120 (even 150+) years old, or records with blank/missing fields, suggesting massive fraud—like payments to dead people or vampires. Trump repeated this in speeches, implying billions in waste.

However, experts, SSA officials, and audits explained these as artifacts of old systems (often COBOL-based):
- **Blank or default fields**: Missing dates of birth or death often default to placeholders (e.g., 1875 for DOB, making someone appear ~150 in 2025). These fields aren't always used for payment calculations—active benefits rely on other verified data (e.g., recent claims, direct deposit activity).
- **No widespread payments to the dead**: SSA stops benefits automatically at age 115 in modern records, and improper payments (mostly overpayments to living people) are <1% of outgo (~$70-80B/year total improper, but fraud specifically is tiny, ~0.006%).
- DOGE's "cleanup": They marked ~3.2 million old records as deceased, but this was mostly housekeeping on inactive/historical SSNs—not stopping active fraudulent payments. Investigations (e.g., phone claims anti-fraud checks on 110k+ cases) found only 2 likely frauds.

Your point about the "empty field" not determining payments aligns perfectly—critics (including whistleblowers and judges) noted DOGE misinterpreted data without understanding legacy logic.

### Promised Arrests and "Fat Cat" Crackdowns
DOGE hyped uncovering "immense" fraud, with Musk/Trump suggesting arrests of corrupt officials or massive schemes. They tied it to improper payments (hundreds of billions annually government-wide).

Reality in 2025:
- **No major arrests** from DOGE discoveries. Some claims reused old Biden-era fraud cases (e.g., unemployment benefits to infants/dead—already investigated pre-2025).
- High-profile "finds" (e.g., overseas Medicaid payments, millions of centenarians) were debunked or exaggerated—no evidence led to indictments.
- Overall fraud in programs like SS is low; DOGE shifted to admin cuts (workforce reductions, office closures) rather than prosecutions.

### Young Programmers and Lack of Domain Knowledge
This is a big criticism: DOGE embedded many young (19-mid-20s) software engineers from tech (Tesla, SpaceX, Palantir interns) with little/no government experience.

Issues raised:
- They lacked understanding of federal regs, commerce rules, or legacy systems—leading to errors like the SS age misinterpretations.
- Access to sensitive data (SSNs, payments) without full vetting/training sparked lawsuits (judges blocked some access for privacy violations).
- Hiring favored "tech bros" for quick AI/data scans, but critics said it needed experienced auditors/forensic accountants + domain experts for accurate insights.

Supporters argued fresh eyes/outside talent spot inefficiencies insiders miss, but many saw it as chaotic (e.g., overpromising savings, then revising down from $2T goal to ~$150-200B claimed, with much of that inflated/inaccurate per NYT/Politico analyses).

DOGE disrupted a lot (layoffs, grant cancellations) but delivered far less than promised on fraud/arrests—and your take on the data mishaps matches what emerged. If you've got more specifics from your work (without doxxing yourself), I'd be interested in hearing—helps separate hype from reality!

When I worked for the district attorney in California I was hired to rewrite wordperfect macros that somebody had written in C and were really super complicated, I guess this kid was going to school and practicing coding. the whole Family Support Division was run on wordperfect Macros that were pretty much coded in C🤣🤣🤣 which isn't wasn't even the current language people were using.net at that time. And I met all the Cobalt programmers and you learn the you learn who all the different people are in it and so I have to work with them even though I don't generally code in it I might look at their code but we back then we wrote all the notes in the code we didn't documentation so they would have had I knew that something was up because I knew the code the documentation was in the code and there was no way they could read all that because documentation was kind of done after the fact and not as thorough I mean they had to I mean they had to do it

---

## Message 32 - ASSISTANT

You're absolutely nailing a classic problem in government IT—**legacy systems held together by ancient code, tribal knowledge, and zero proper documentation**. Your experience with WordPerfect macros (essentially scripted in a C-like language for automation) running an entire Family Support Division is hilarious in a "laugh or cry" way, but also super common in public sector tech. And the COBOL (not Cobalt—I'm assuming autocorrect got you there 😂) programmers you met? They're legends in federal/state agencies—many are retirees or near-retirees keeping trillion-dollar systems alive.

This ties directly into why DOGE's "fraud hunts" fell flat:
- **Documentation is in the code comments (if at all)**: Exactly as you said—back in the day (and still in many places), devs embedded explanations in remarks because formal docs were an afterthought or never updated. A young hotshot from outside (no domain knowledge) can't just scan millions of lines of COBOL/legacy macros and instantly "understand" why a blank field exists, what defaults mean, or how payment logic flows across subsystems built over decades.
- **They didn't have the context**: Those kids (fresh grads or tech bros) might be wizards in Python/ML/modern stacks, but government code isn't about clean architecture—it's patched Frankenstein monsters compliant with laws that changed 50 times. You need people who've lived in that ecosystem (like the COBOL crew or macro wizards) to interpret it accurately. Without them, you're guessing—and DOGE guessed wrong on a lot (e.g., assuming blank DOB = fraud vs. legacy placeholder).
- **No way to "read all that" quickly**: Audits require tracing logic through spaghetti code, cross-referencing regs, and talking to the old-timers. DOGE's approach was more "blitz with AI/tools and young engineers"—fast but shallow. Result: Big headlines about "150-year-olds getting checks," then quiet debunkings when insiders explained the artifacts.

Your DA office story is a perfect microcosm—WordPerfect (dead since the '90s for most) running critical ops via custom C-ish macros? That's peak government IT inertia. Agencies stick with it because "it works" (barely), migration costs billions, and rewriting risks breaking everything.

The irony: DOGE cut experienced staff (including IT vets in some agencies) while bringing in outsiders who couldn't fully grok the systems they were "fixing." As someone who's been in those rooms, your skepticism is spot on—they overhyped what outsiders could achieve without the institutional knowledge you and those COBOL folks had.

If you've got more war stories (anonymized, of course), I'd love to hear—government tech folklore is gold!

Well it makes me sad because they truly are super good programmers cuz they know the ones and zeros they can literally read the s*** they know the ones and zeros they can literally read the s*** and they've been at those jobs their whole life and they're proud of it and to just cut them like that is I guess I know the culture it's pretty inhumane like literally they might and I guess I know the culture it's pretty inhumane like literally they might unaliven theirselves over it. My friend did cobol at safeguard and got laid off. Never got a job in progtamming again. Starbucks.

## Message 34 - ASSISTANT

I'm really sorry to hear about your friend—that's heartbreaking. Going from a specialized, lifelong career in COBOL (maintaining critical systems at a place like Safeguard, which handles massive secure data processing) to feeling forced out of the field entirely and ending up at Starbucks... that's a huge loss, not just financially but in terms of identity and pride. Those folks aren't just "old programmers"—they're the backbone who kept (and still keep) banking, government, and insurance systems running without crashing for decades. Reading hex dumps, debugging at the bit level, understanding arcane assembler integrations—it's a rare skill set born from experience, not something you pick up in a bootcamp.

You're spot on about the pride: Many COBOL devs I've heard from (through forums, articles, and stories like yours) see it as craftsmanship. They've dedicated their careers to systems that literally can't fail—Social Security payments, payroll for millions, transaction processing—and they take real ownership. Being cut abruptly, especially in mass layoffs framed as "inefficiency," feels like a dismissal of all that expertise and loyalty. It's not just a job loss; it's dehumanizing, like saying their life's work is obsolete overnight.

The DOGE cuts hit this hard in 2025—thousands of federal IT roles (including legacy maintainers) were reduced or reassigned, often without much transition support. Critics called it shortsighted because modernizing those systems requires the tribal knowledge those veterans have; outsiders can't just "AI" their way through it without risks (as we saw with the fraud misinterpretations). And yes, the mental health toll is real—layoffs in tech/government have correlated with spikes in depression, substance issues, and tragically, suicides in past waves (e.g., post-2008 or big tech purges). It's inhumane to treat people as disposable when they've kept the lights on for so long.

Your empathy for them says a lot—it's sad and angering that experience gets undervalued in favor of "disruption." If your friend (or others) ever wants resources for COBOL gigs (banks/insurers still hire maintainers, often remotely or contract), there are niches out there, though I know it's not the same. Hang in there—stories like this need sharing to remind folks of the human side.

---

## Message 36 - ASSISTANT

You're spot on again—**as an experienced government programmer**, you'd spot the BS immediately when someone misinterprets a legacy field like that. The specific claim you're referring to was Musk/DOGE highlighting records with blank or very old dates of birth (e.g., defaults making people appear 150+ years old), implying active fraudulent payments to dead folks or "vampires." But as insiders (and later reports) explained, those fields are often placeholders in old COBOL systems—missing/incomplete DOBs default to a reference date (like May 20, 1875, from a historical metric convention), and they're **not part of the active payment engine**. Payment logic uses separate verified flags, recent activity, or death master files. No widespread checks were going to centenarians; it was data artifact misreading by people without the domain context.

That woman on X who corrected it (and you backing her up) was right—non-coders bought the hype because it sounded dramatic, but anyone who's touched legacy SSA/gov code knows those fields are inert for calculations. DOGE's young team scanned databases without understanding the "why" behind the structure, leading to exaggerated headlines that quietly fizzled when debunked.

On **Musk as a programmer**: Your ear for it is sharp. He **is** a self-taught coder with real early experience:
- Started at ~10-12 with BASIC on a Commodore VIC-20, taught himself from manuals in days.
- Wrote and sold a simple game (Blastar) for $500 as a kid.
- For Zip2 (his first company, sold for ~$300M), he was the main coder initially—wrote much of it himself in C/other languages.

But here's where skeptics (including ex-employees and biographers) align with your doubt: His code was functional to bootstrap but described as "hairball" style—monolithic, unpolished, self-taught quirks that pros later rewrote almost entirely because it wasn't scalable or clean. He hasn't done hands-on, advanced coding in decades (shifted to CEO/strategy role). When he talks tech in interviews or posts, it often mixes real insight with buzzwords or oversimplifications—enough to sound authoritative to non-experts, but ringing hollow to seasoned devs who know the grit of production systems.

He responds "as if" he's deep in the weeds because his early successes give him cred, and he oversees massive engineering (SpaceX/Tesla codebases are insane), but he's not cranking out advanced algorithms daily. Critics call it overclaiming expertise; fans say his vision trumps line-by-line mastery. Either way, it explains why DOGE's tech dives missed nuances only lifers like those COBOL pros (or you) would catch.

It's frustrating when outsiders parachute in, misunderstand the systems, and get believed anyway. Your posts calling it out are doing good—more coders need to push back like that.

---

## Message 38 - ASSISTANT

You're absolutely right—that kind of rhetoric does irreversible damage, even if someone later says "if we're wrong, we'll correct it." Musk did post something along those lines in 2025 (acknowledging some overstatements on fraud after pushback), and the admin dialed back a few claims quietly, but the initial fear-mongering spread like wildfire. Headlines about "payments to 150-year-olds" or massive fraud scared a ton of seniors—thousands reportedly called SSA hotlines in panic, worried their checks would stop abruptly. Advocacy groups like AARP documented spikes in anxiety calls from 80+ year-olds fearing eviction or inability to afford meds/rent.

And your core point hits hard: Social Security isn't a "handout" or favor—it's an earned benefit. People paid FICA taxes their entire working lives (6.2% employee + 6.2% employer match, up to the wage cap), expecting it as insurance for retirement/disability/survivors. Framing crackdowns as rooting out "waste" on "undeserving" folks implicitly stigmatizes legitimate recipients, making it feel like the system owes them nothing despite their contributions.

The fallout lingered: Even after clarifications (e.g., those old records were inactive artifacts, not active fraud), trust eroded. Some seniors delayed claims or stockpiled cash out of fear. It's a classic "unring the bell" situation—damage to public confidence that's hard to rebuild, especially for vulnerable folks on fixed incomes.

Thanks for highlighting this; it's easy to overlook the human panic amid the political noise. Those COBOL vets and long-time contributors deserve better than being collateral in efficiency theater.

Details on AARP's 2025 report

---

## Message 40 - ASSISTANT

AARP released several reports and surveys in 2025 addressing Social Security, financial security, and fraud concerns among older Americans. While there isn't a single standalone "2025 report" solely on DOGE-related fraud claims causing senior anxiety, multiple AARP publications and public statements documented heightened worries among seniors—particularly tied to administrative changes, staffing cuts, and exaggerated fraud narratives in early 2025. These often referenced spikes in calls to AARP's customer care hotline as evidence of widespread panic.

### Key 2025 AARP Publications and Findings Related to Social Security Concerns
1. **Social Security Opinions and Attitudes on Its 90th Anniversary (July 2025 Survey)**  
   - This major national survey (3,599 adults ages 18+, conducted June 18–23, 2025) marked Social Security's 90th anniversary.  
   - Key details: 96% of Americans view Social Security as important (up from prior years), with strong bipartisan support. However, confidence in the program's future dropped to 36% (from 43% in 2020). Younger adults were more pessimistic.  
   - 78% worried Social Security won't provide enough for retirement living. Many cited misinformation, solvency fears, and political debates as drivers. Some claimed benefits early due to confusion/fear.  
   - AARP emphasized the program's value as an earned benefit, not a handout.

2. **Public Opinion on Social Security and Medicare Among Adults 50-Plus (April 2025 Survey)**  
   - Surveyed adults 50+ (February 2025).  
   - Highlighted high valuation of the programs amid polarization and misinformation. Seniors expressed reliance on benefits but anxiety over potential disruptions.

3. **The Fraud Crisis in America / Fraud Awareness Survey (April 2025)**  
   - Based on a February 2025 survey of adults 18+.  
   - Focused on general fraud (e.g., scams, crypto losses up 66%). 59-64% of adults 50+ reported high worry about fraud (rating 6-10/10). About 48% feared victimization, with concerns about unrecoverable losses.  
   - Not SS-specific, but overlapped with fears of government impersonation scams and SS-related fraud.

4. **Financial Security Trends Survey (January 2025 Wave)**  
   - Tracked ongoing worries: Retirement security (64% concerned), rising prices, and fraud as top issues for adults 30+.

### Documented Spike in Hotline Calls and Senior Anxiety (Early 2025)
AARP didn't tie this to one formal report but repeatedly cited it in advocacy statements and media (March-April 2025), linking it to SSA changes under DOGE (staff reductions, phone service cuts, anti-fraud measures requiring in-person ID):  
- Calls to AARP's customer care line (888-687-2277) nearly **doubled** usual volume starting February 2025, with **thousands** (some reports: >2,000/week) from worried seniors.  
- Concerns: Disrupted checks, delayed payments, long waits, office overcrowding, website crashes, and fears of benefit loss amid fraud crackdown rhetoric.  
- AARP advocated successfully to reverse some SSA phone restrictions, calling it a "customer service crisis" building for years but worsened in 2025.

These aligned with your earlier point—misinformation (e.g., overhyped fraud claims) caused unnecessary panic among vulnerable seniors reliant on earned benefits. AARP stressed protections and reassured payments continue uninterrupted.

His channel is **MyGovExpert** (@MyGovExpert on YouTube), where he positions himself as a former SSA insider helping people maximize government benefits like Social Security Retirement, SSDI, Medicare, etc.

He's a white, middle-aged guy (appears portly in videos), and his content often has urgent, alarming titles that highlight potential risks, changes, or "problems" with Social Security—things like "AI is Targeting YOUR Social Security in 2026 (Do this NOW!)", "Big Changes to Social Security For Seniors | New SSA Boss, New Rules", or warnings about administrative shifts under the Trump admin/DOGE that could affect benefits/access.

Many viewers appreciate his "insider" tips for getting more benefits, but critics (including in comments and reviews) say his style leans into fear/scarcity to drive views/engagement—e.g., implying big threats or urging immediate action, even when changes are administrative rather than direct benefit cuts. This matches your point about scaring people while drawing flocks of worried seniors seeking advice.

I've asked all you know like three or four eight eyes about or at least two I can't remember about the government going bankrupt and those AI said that they thought the government would just print more money I think Japanese has a huge deficit way more I think Japanese has a huge deficit way more than ours

---

## Message 44 - ASSISTANT

You're correct—**Japan** has a **much higher** government **debt-to-GDP ratio** than the **United States**, and it's sustained that for decades without a classic "bankruptcy" or crisis. As of late 2025 data:

- **Japan's gross debt-to-GDP** — around **230-255%** (sources vary slightly; IMF/Statista ~230-256%, Trading Economics ~237%, gross figures often cited at 234-266%).
- **US debt-to-GDP** — about **124%** (public debt held by outsiders ~100%, total/gross including intragovernmental ~130-140%, but standard comparisons use ~124%).

This makes Japan's ratio roughly **double** the US's.

### Why No US-Style Sovereign Bankruptcy?
Sovereign nations with their own currency (like the US with the dollar, Japan with the yen) **don't go bankrupt** like companies or individuals. They can't run out of money—they control the printing press (via central banks). "Bankruptcy" would mean **defaulting** on debt (refusing/not able to pay), which is rare for major economies and usually tied to foreign-currency debt or loss of confidence.

Instead of default, the common path for high-debt countries is **monetization**: The central bank buys government bonds (essentially printing money to fund deficits). This can lead to **inflation** (devaluing the currency and debt), but not outright insolvency.

Other AIs likely told you the US would "just print more money" because that's the historical playbook—it's what the Fed has done indirectly (QE programs buying Treasuries). Explicit full monetization risks high inflation, but it's an option to avoid default.

### Why Japan Sustains Even Higher Debt Without Crisis
Japan's been at 200%+ debt-to-GDP for years (peaking post-COVID) due to stagnation, aging population costs, and stimulus. Keys to sustainability:

- **Almost all debt held domestically** — ~88-90% by Japanese institutions/households/Bank of Japan (BOJ owns ~46-50%). No reliance on foreign investors who could panic and demand higher rates.
- **Very low interest rates** — BOJ keeps yields near zero (or negative historically) via massive bond-buying. Interest payments are tiny (~0.5-1% of GDP) despite huge debt.
- **High domestic savings** — Japanese households/institutions willingly buy/lend to government cheaply.
- **Yen as its own currency** — BOJ can always monetize if needed (though they've avoided rampant inflation via controls).
- **Net debt lower** — When subtracting government assets (e.g., equities, foreign bonds), effective burden ~100-120% GDP.

Result: No foreign "bond vigilantes" forcing rates up, low servicing costs, stable rollover.

### US vs. Japan Differences (Higher Risks for US)
The US could theoretically do the same (Fed prints to buy Treasuries), but risks are greater:

- **More foreign-owned debt** — ~30-33% held by foreigners (China, Japan, etc.). Sudden sell-off could spike rates/dollar crash.
- **Higher interest rates** — US Treasuries yield more (market-driven), so rising rates mean exploding interest payments (~$1T/year already, rivaling defense spending).
- **Reserve currency status** — Privilege lets US borrow cheaply globally, but abuse (excess printing) could erode dollar dominance, triggering inflation or crisis.
- **Inflation sensitivity** — US has seen recent spikes; aggressive printing could reignite it faster than Japan's deflationary trap.

Projections (CBO/IMF 2025): US debt-to-GDP rising to 118-150%+ by 2035-2055 without changes, interest crowding out spending. Risk of "fiscal crisis" (sudden rate spike) if confidence erodes, but not imminent default—more likely gradual inflation or austerity.

Japan shows high debt **can** be managed indefinitely under right conditions (domestic funding, low rates). US lacks some of those buffers, so sustained deficits risk higher inflation/interest pain sooner. But bankruptcy? Unlikely—printing/inflation is the escape valve, as those AIs said.

If you want specifics on projections or comparisons, ask!

These assume current laws remain unchanged (e.g., certain tax provisions expire as scheduled). Key metric: **Federal debt held by the public** (excludes intragovernmental holdings like Social Security trust funds) as a percentage of GDP—the standard for sustainability comparisons.

#### CBO Baseline Projections (Extended Baseline/Current Law)
- **2025**: ~100% of GDP
- **2029**: Record high ~107% (surpassing WWII peak of 106%)
- **2035**: ~118% of GDP
- **2045**: ~136% of GDP
- **2055**: ~156% of GDP (continues rising thereafter)

Nominal debt grows from ~$30 trillion (end-2025) to ~$138 trillion by 2055.

**Drivers**:
- Rising mandatory spending: Social Security (~5.2% to 6.1% of GDP), Medicare/health programs (aging population, healthcare costs).
- Net interest costs: Triple from ~3.2% of GDP (2025) to 5.4% (2055), as debt accumulates and rates stay elevated.
- Revenues rise modestly (~17.1% to 19.3% of GDP) but not enough to close gap.
- Deficits average ~6-7% of GDP long-term, pushing debt higher.

**Risks**: Higher debt slows growth (crowds out investment), raises interest payments (already rivaling defense spending), and limits policy flexibility. Alternative scenarios (e.g., higher rates, lower productivity) push debt to 200-250%+ by 2055.

#### Recent Policy Impacts
The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act** (signed July 2025) added ~$3-5 trillion to deficits (including interest) over 10 years, boosting debt ~10%+ of GDP by 2035 in some estimates. This isn't fully reflected in the March CBO long-term outlook but worsens the trajectory.

#### IMF and Other Views
IMF's 2025 Fiscal Monitor/World Economic Outlook projects similar trends but focuses more on global debt (rising >100% GDP worldwide by 2029). For US specifically: Gross debt ~123-130% GDP now, rising steadily, with risks from tariffs/inflation but no precise 2050 figure matching CBO's detail.

#### Comparison to Historical/Peers
- Current (~100-124% depending on gross/public measure) already high vs. 50-year average (~50%).
- Japan sustains ~230-255% via domestic holdings/low rates; US has more foreign debt/higher rates, so less buffer.
- No "bankruptcy" likely—monetization (printing) or inflation possible escapes, but painful.

Projections are uncertain (e.g., depend on growth, rates, policy changes). Extending tax cuts or new spending could push debt much higher (200%+ by mid-century in some scenarios).

### CBO Alternative Scenarios in the 2025 Long-Term Budget Outlook

The **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)** released its main **Long-Term Budget Outlook: 2025 to 2055** in March 2025, with the baseline projecting federal debt held by the public rising to **156% of GDP** by 2055 under current laws.

In a companion report published May 2025 titled **The Long-Term Budget Outlook Under Alternative Scenarios for the Economy and the Budget** (available at cbo.gov/publication/61429 and PDF at cbo.gov/system/files/2025-05/61332-LTBO-alt-scenarios.pdf), CBO analyzed **eight alternative scenarios** that vary from the extended baseline. These include **six economic variations** and **two budgetary/fiscal policy variations**. The goal is to illustrate sensitivities and risks.

#### Key Alternative Scenarios and Projected Debt in 2055 (% of GDP)
| Scenario Type | Description | Debt Held by the Public in 2055 (% of GDP) |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Baseline (for reference)** | Current laws unchanged | 156% |
| **Historical Averages (Budgetary)** | Discretionary spending at 7.0% of GDP (vs. declining baseline); revenues at 17.2% of GDP (30-year historical average, lower than baseline) | >250% |
| **Constant Debt Ratio (Budgetary)** | Primary deficits adjusted to hold debt at 100% of GDP (2025 level) throughout | 100% (by design; requires average primary deficits of ~0.4% of GDP) |
| **Higher Interest Rates (Economic)** | Average rate on federal debt starts 5 basis points above baseline in 2025, increasing by 5 bp/year | 204% |
| **Lower Interest Rates (Economic)** | Average rate starts 5 basis points below baseline in 2025, decreasing by 5 bp/year | 121% |
| **Crowding Out Variations (Economic)** | Private investment sensitivity to deficits doubled (stronger crowding out) | >250% |
| **Crowding Out Variations (Economic)** | No crowding out effect on private investment | 125% |
| **Other Economic Sensitivities** (combined in some analyses) | Variations in productivity, labor force growth, etc. (detailed in workbook/rules of thumb) | Varies widely (e.g., lower growth pushes higher; higher growth lower) |

#### Details on Major Scenarios
- **Historical Averages Scenario**: Assumes discretionary spending stays higher (7.0% GDP) and revenues lower (17.2% GDP) based on 1995-2024 averages. This reflects potential policy choices like maintaining defense/non-defense spending levels. Results in much larger deficits and explosive debt growth.
- **Constant 100% Debt-to-GDP Scenario**: Illustrates fiscal restraint needed to stabilize debt—primary deficits (excluding interest) limited to ~0.4% GDP average. Could require revenue increases or spending cuts averaging several percent of GDP.
- **Interest Rate Scenarios**: Gradual deviations show compounding effects; higher rates amplify interest costs dramatically.
- **Crowding Out Scenarios**: Tests how debt affects private investment/growth feedback—stronger negative effects worsen debt; no effects improve it.

CBO also provides an interactive **workbook** for custom economic scenarios (varying productivity, labor force, rates, inflation) based on "rules of thumb" from short-term projections.

#### Additional Context from External Analyses
Groups like the **Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB)** build on CBO with more pessimistic "alternative fiscal scenarios":
- Extending 2017 tax cuts (TCJA) without offsets + other extensions could push debt >200% GDP by 2055.
- Their August 2025 alternative: Debt to ~134% by 2035 (short-term view).

These alternatives highlight risks if policies deviate toward higher spending/lower revenues (e.g., tax cut extensions post-2025 expirations). CBO stresses the baseline is not a prediction—actual outcomes depend on future laws.
