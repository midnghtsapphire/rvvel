According to the Whale Hunting report and multiple crypto analysts, Venezuela allegedly built this "shadow reserve" through three primary mechanisms while evading US sanctions. The regime reportedly converted approximately $2 billion in gold from the Orinoco Mining Arc into Bitcoin between 2018 and 2020 at average prices near $5,000 per coin. That tranche alone would now be worth roughly $36 billion at current prices.�������Additionally, Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA increasingly settled crude oil exports in Tether (USDT) between 2023 and 2025, then rotated those stablecoins into Bitcoin to avoid the risk of frozen accounts. The Atlantic Council reported in December 2025 that Venezuela had been receiving oil payments in USDT since 2024. Authorities also seized Bitcoin from domestic mining operations during government crackdowns in 2023-2024.�����The report identifies Alex Saab, a longtime Maduro associate who was extradited to the US in 2021 before being released in a 2023 prisoner exchange, as a central figure allegedly controlling access to the wallet infrastructure.��?

The allegations regarding Venezuela's "shadow reserve" of Bitcoin align closely with recent investigative reporting from early January 2026, following the U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro. According to the Whale Hunting newsletter published by Project Brazen on January 3, 2026, the Maduro regime is believed to have amassed a hidden cryptocurrency hoard valued at $56–67 billion, primarily in Bitcoin (estimated at 600,000–660,000 BTC) and some Tether (USDT).<grok:render card_id="4f93fe" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render> This would position Venezuela as one of the world's largest Bitcoin holders, potentially rivaling entities like BlackRock or MicroStrategy, and representing about 3% of Bitcoin's circulating supply.<grok:render card_id="91cb41" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>
</grok:render> The report draws on intelligence sources, including human intelligence (HUMINT), and suggests the accumulation was a deliberate strategy to evade U.S. sanctions.

The three primary mechanisms described in the Whale Hunting report and echoed by crypto analysts match your details:

1. **Gold conversions from the Orinoco Mining Arc**: Between 2018 and 2020, Venezuela reportedly liquidated around 73 tons of gold (valued at roughly $2–2.7 billion at the time) and converted a significant portion into Bitcoin at average prices near $5,000 per BTC.<grok:render card_id="7d5a4c" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render> This yielded approximately 400,000 BTC, which at Bitcoin's price around $90,000 in early 2026 would indeed be worth about $36 billion.<grok:render card_id="183a5a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render> Sources like Reuters and the Wilson Center provided historical data on the gold sales, which were funneled through opaque networks.<grok:render card_id="da522c" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">5</argument>
</grok:render>

2. **Oil export settlements in USDT, rotated to BTC**: Starting in 2023–2024, PDVSA (Venezuela's state oil company) increasingly required buyers to pay for crude exports in USDT to circumvent sanctions and reduce the risk of asset freezes.<grok:render card_id="7f26ed" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render> An Atlantic Council analysis from November 2025 (not December, based on available reports) highlighted this shift, noting the regime's growing use of digital assets for oil transactions since at least 2024.<grok:render card_id="995a07" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">23</argument>
</grok:render> Intelligence indicates that a portion of these stablecoin inflows—potentially from 80% of exports in late 2025—was then converted into Bitcoin for long-term holding.<grok:render card_id="8e0e5e" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render>

3. **Seizures from domestic mining operations**: During government crackdowns on unauthorized mining in 2023–2024, authorities allegedly confiscated Bitcoin and equipment from local operations, adding to the reserve.<grok:render card_id="5e632c" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>
</grok:render> This was part of broader efforts to centralize control over crypto activities amid energy shortages and regulatory enforcement.

Alex Saab, a key Maduro associate extradited to the U.S. in 2021 and released in a 2023 prisoner swap, is identified as a central figure potentially controlling wallet access through a network involving a Swiss lawyer.<grok:render card_id="189d8f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">2</argument>
</grok:render> No specific wallet addresses have been publicly verified or disclosed in these reports, and blockchain analytics firms like those referenced in Cointelegraph have not yet confirmed the holdings on-chain, labeling them as speculative.<grok:render card_id="0939dc" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render> If seized by U.S. authorities post-Maduro's capture, this reserve could create a supply shock, potentially driving Bitcoin prices higher by removing a large chunk from circulation—markets saw BTC climb to $93,000 in response to the news.<grok:render card_id="47e9a0" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">16</argument>
</grok:render>

These claims remain unverified by official Venezuelan sources or comprehensive on-chain evidence, and some analysts view them as directional estimates rather than precise figures.<grok:render card_id="008e4d" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">9</argument>
</grok:render> The geopolitical context, including U.S. strikes and oil reserve discussions, adds complexity, but the allegations are substantiated across multiple independent outlets.
