I need create music label. Suggestions?

## Message 2 - ASSISTANT

Starting a **music label** (often called a record label) is an exciting venture, especially in 2026 when independent labels are thriving amid streaming growth, hybrid genres, and artist empowerment. Indies now hold significant market share, and tools make it more accessible than ever. Here's a practical guide with key suggestions to get you started.

### 1. Define Your Vision and Niche
Focus on a specific genre or sound to stand out—current trends include hybrid genres (e.g., pluggnB, Afrofuturism, rock/metal revival), nostalgic Y2K vibes, emotional/cinematic tracks, and global influences. Ask yourself:
- What music excites you? (e.g., underground electronic, indie rock, hip-hop collectives)
- Who is your target audience and artists?
- Will you emphasize sustainability, human-made music (vs. AI-heavy), or community-building?

Pro tip: Start small as an indie label supporting unsigned artists who value creative control.

### 2. Choose a Memorable Name and Brand
Your name should be catchy, available as a domain/social handle, and reflect your vibe. Some creative ideas:
- EchoForge Records
- Nebula Pulse Music
- Vortex Echo Label
- Lunar Drift Records
- Sonic Haven Collective
- Rhythm Eclipse
- Aura Wave Records
- Phantom Groove
- Celestial Beat Co.
- Infinite Loop Music

Check availability on domain registrars and trademark sites. Design a simple logo (tools like Canva work great) and build a visual identity (colors, fonts) for album art, merch, and socials.

### 3. Handle the Legal and Business Basics
Register your label as a business (e.g., LLC for protection)—costs vary by location but start low.
- Get necessary licenses, EIN/tax ID, and bank account.
- Join a performing rights organization (PRO) like ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC to collect royalties.
- Consult a music lawyer for contracts (artist agreements, splits—aim for fair 50/50 deals to attract talent).
- Budget: You can start with under $10,000 (digital-focused) or more for physical releases.

### 4. Sign Artists and Release Music
Scout talent via Spotify playlists, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Instagram submissions, or local scenes.
- Start with friends or one forgiving artist for your first release.
- Use digital distributors to get music on Spotify, Apple Music, TikTok, etc. Top options for indies in 2026:
  - DistroKid: Unlimited uploads, keep 100% royalties, fast and cheap.
  - TuneCore: Strong for global reach and promotions.
  - CD Baby: Great support, one-time fees.
  - Ditto Music or Identity Music: Label-friendly tools and playlist pitching.
  - For more support: Consider selective ones like AWAL (invite-only, label-like services).

Focus on consistent releases—plan campaigns with teasers, visuals, and fan engagement.

### 5. Marketing and Growth Strategies
Build online presence: Website (via Bandzoogle or Squarespace), strong socials (TikTok/Instagram for virality, X for networking).
- Promote via playlists, ads, collabs, and sync licensing (TV/film).
- Trends to leverage: Short-form video content, fan communities, merch/lifestyle tie-ins, and global markets (e.g., emerging regions driving streams).
- Network: Attend events, connect with pluggers, bloggers, and other indies.

### Final Tips
- Be patient—profit takes time; focus on passion and building a community.
- Stay independent-friendly: Offer artists ownership and transparency.
- Track trends: AI tools for production, but emphasize "human-made" authenticity; rising girl groups/collectives; nostalgic formats like vinyl/cassettes for merch.

If you share more details (e.g., your genre, budget, or location), I can refine these suggestions further. Good luck—you've got this! 🎶

What naic code and selections for ein busuness structure and sos articles

## Message 4 - ASSISTANT

### **NAICS Code for a Music Record Label**
The most appropriate **NAICS code** for a record label (focused on signing artists, producing, releasing, promoting, and distributing music recordings) is **512250 - Record Production and Distribution**.

- This covers establishments that contract with artists, finance/produce master recordings, and handle promotion/distribution (physical or digital).
- It's under the broader category **5122 - Sound Recording Industries**.

Alternatives if your focus differs:
- **512230** → Music Publishing (if mainly handling copyrights/songwriter royalties).
- **512240** → Sound Recording Studios (if primarily a recording facility).
- **512220** → Integrated Record Production/Distribution (sometimes used for major labels with full vertical integration).

Use **512250** for most independent labels. You can confirm/verify on the official NAICS site or during business registration.

### **Business Structure Recommendations (for EIN and Overall Setup)**
For a new independent music label, the **recommended structure is a Limited Liability Company (LLC)**. Here's why and the options:

- **LLC (Strongly Recommended)**:
  - Provides **personal liability protection** (your home, car, savings are shielded from business lawsuits/debts—critical in music with potential copyright disputes or artist contracts).
  - Flexible taxation: Defaults to pass-through (like sole prop), but you can elect S-Corp or C-Corp status later for tax savings.
  - Easy to set up and maintain, professional credibility (e.g., "Your Label LLC").
  - Ideal for solo or small teams planning growth, signing artists, or seeking investors.

- **Sole Proprietorship**:
  - Simplest and free—no filing needed.
  - But **no liability protection** (personal assets at risk) and less professional.
  - Fine for very low-risk hobbies, but not advised for a label dealing with contracts.

- **Corporation (C-Corp or S-Corp)**:
  - More complex/expensive; better for large-scale growth or raising major investment.
  - S-Corp can reduce self-employment taxes once profitable.

Most indie labels start as a **single-member LLC** (if solo) or multi-member (if partners).

#### **For EIN Application (IRS Form SS-4)**
When applying for your free **Employer Identification Number (EIN)** online at irs.gov:
- **Type of Entity**: Select "Limited Liability Company (LLC)".
- **Number of Members**: 1 (single-member) or more.
- **Tax Classification**: Defaults to disregarded entity (taxed as sole prop if single-member), but you can later file Form 2553 for S-Corp election.
- Even sole props can get an EIN (recommended for bank accounts/privacy), but select "Sole Proprietor" if not forming an LLC.

You'll need an EIN for business banking, hiring, or tax filings.

### **Articles of Organization (for LLC Formation with Secretary of State - "SOS")**
"Articles of Organization" (or "Certificate of Formation/Organization" in some states) is the document you file with your state's Secretary of State (SOS) to create the LLC. Costs vary ($50–$500+).

Standard required info (no music-specific extras needed):
- LLC name (must include "LLC" or similar; check availability).
- Principal office address.
- Registered agent (person/entity to receive legal docs—can be you or a service).
- Purpose statement: Use general like "any lawful purpose" (most states allow this; no need to specify "music label").
- Management structure: Member-managed (common for small labels) or manager-managed.
- Duration: Perpetual (default).
- Organizer's name/signature.

Some states require more (e.g., member names). File online via your state's SOS website. After approval, draft an **Operating Agreement** (internal rules—not filed, but essential for clarity on ownership, profits, etc.).

**Pro Tips**:
- Use services like ZenBusiness/LegalZoom for easy filing if DIY feels overwhelming.
- Consult a lawyer/accountant for your state specifics (rules vary, e.g., California has extra fees).
- After LLC: Get business licenses if needed, open a business bank account, and join PROs (ASCAP/BMI) for royalties.

This setup protects you while keeping things simple for a starting label. Share your state or if it's solo/multi-member for more tailored advice! 🎵

Im doing mult member passive llc

### **Multi-Member LLC with Passive Members ("Passive LLC")**

A **multi-member LLC** (2+ owners/members) defaults to the same formation and tax rules as any multi-member LLC—having **passive members** (investors who don't actively manage or participate in operations) doesn't create a separate "passive LLC" category with the IRS or most states. "Passive" refers to how members' income is treated for **self-employment taxes** and **passive activity loss rules** (e.g., limited partners in some structures avoid SE tax), but it's defined in your **Operating Agreement**, not at formation.

This setup works great for a music label: one or more active members run operations (signing artists, releases, marketing), while passive members provide funding and share profits/losses without day-to-day involvement.

#### **NAICS Code (Unchanged)**
Stick with **512250 - Record Production and Distribution**.  
This covers active record label activities (producing, promoting, distributing recordings).  
Even with passive investors, the LLC's primary business is the label's operations—not pure investment holding.  
If it ever shifts to purely holding royalties/investments (no active production), reconsider **512230 (Music Publishers)** or investment codes—but that's rare for starting labels.

#### **Business Structure & EIN Application**
- **Structure**: Multi-member LLC (default federal tax classification: **Partnership**).  
  - The IRS automatically treats any LLC with 2+ members as a partnership unless you elect otherwise (via Form 8832 for C-Corp or Form 2553 for S-Corp).  
  - Passive members don't change this—it's still a partnership for filing (Form 1065 informational return; members get K-1s and report on personal taxes).  
  - Benefits: Pass-through taxation (no double tax), flexibility for profit splits not tied to ownership.

- **EIN Application (irs.gov online)**:  
  - Select **Limited Liability Company (LLC)**.  
  - Number of members: 2 or more.  
  - The system will note: "multi-member LLC → classified as a partnership."  
  - Responsible party: Usually the primary/active member.  
  - No special "passive" option—it's standard multi-member.

- **Tax Implications for Passive Members**:  
  - In a standard member-managed LLC, all members' shares are usually subject to self-employment tax (15.3% on net earnings).  
  - To treat passive members' income as non-SE (like limited partners): Structure as **manager-managed** in your Operating Agreement, with passive members having limited roles (no management/voting rights).  
  - IRS proposed rules (still relied on) allow non-SE treatment if the member: works <500 hours/year, has no binding authority, and limited liability.  
  - Consult a tax pro—many labels elect S-Corp status later to minimize SE taxes via salaries/distributions.

#### **Articles of Organization (Secretary of State Filing)**
No changes needed for passive members—these are public formation docs and don't detail internal roles.  
Standard requirements (varies slightly by state):  
- LLC name (with "LLC" or similar).  
- Principal office/address.  
- Registered agent (you or a service).  
- Purpose: "Any lawful purpose" (fine for a music label—no need to specify).  
- Management: **Member-managed** (default; all members have authority) **OR** **Manager-managed** (recommended for passive setup—appoint active member(s) as manager(s)).  
  - Choose manager-managed to clearly separate passive investors.  
- Members: Most states **do not require listing member names** publicly (great for privacy). If yours does (e.g., some like NY), list them but note roles elsewhere.  
- Organizer signature.

File online/via your state's SOS site. Cost: $50–$500.

**Key Next Step: Operating Agreement (Private, Not Filed)**  
This is where you define "passive" vs. active:  
- Ownership percentages, capital contributions.  
- Management: Manager-managed; name active managers.  
- Voting rights: Limit passive members (e.g., major decisions only).  
- Profit/loss distributions (can be unequal).  
- Passive protections: No day-to-day duties, limited liability emphasis.  
- Buyout/exit rules for investors.  
Use a template (e.g., multi-member manager-managed) and customize with a lawyer—critical for investor attraction and tax treatment.

This keeps things protected and investor-friendly while running your label actively. Share your state or number of members for more specifics! 🎧

### Sample Operating Agreement Clauses for Your Multi-Member Manager-Managed LLC (Music Label)

Below are **sample clauses** tailored for a multi-member, **manager-managed LLC** with passive members (e.g., investors funding the label while active members handle operations like signing artists, releases, and marketing). These are drawn from standard templates and best practices for entertainment-related LLCs.

**Important Disclaimer**: These are illustrative samples only—not legal advice. LLC laws vary by state, and music labels involve unique risks (e.g., IP, contracts). **Always have a qualified attorney customize and review your full Operating Agreement** to ensure it complies with your state's laws and fits your specific setup.

#### 1. Management Structure (Key for Passive Members)
This establishes manager-managed structure, limiting passive members' involvement.

**Sample Clause**:
"The Company shall be manager-managed. The Managers shall have full and exclusive authority to manage and control the day-to-day business, affairs, and properties of the Company, including but not limited to signing artist agreements, entering into distribution contracts, and handling marketing and promotions. Non-managing Members (Passive Members) shall not participate in the management or control of the Company's business and shall have no authority to bind the Company or act on its behalf. The initial Manager(s) shall be [Name(s) of Active Member(s)]. Managers may be removed or replaced by a vote of [e.g., majority/super-majority] of the Membership Interests."

#### 2. Members and Ownership Percentages
Lists members and their roles/ownership.

**Sample Clause**:
"The Members of the Company are:  
- [Active Member Name] – [e.g., 60%] Ownership Interest (Managing Member)  
- [Passive Investor 1] – [e.g., 20%] Ownership Interest (Non-Managing Member)  
- [Passive Investor 2] – [e.g., 20%] Ownership Interest (Non-Managing Member)  

Membership Interests represent each Member's ownership percentage and right to distributions. Passive Members shall have limited or no voting rights except on Major Decisions (as defined below)."

#### 3. Capital Contributions
Tracks what each member invests (critical for investors).

**Sample Clause**:
"Initial Capital Contributions:  
- [Active Member] contributes [e.g., services, equipment, intellectual property valued at $X].  
- [Passive Member 1] contributes [e.g., $Y cash].  
- [Passive Member 2] contributes [e.g., $Z cash].  

No interest shall be paid on Capital Contributions. Additional contributions may be required only with [unanimous/majority] approval. Failure to make additional contributions may result in dilution of the non-contributing Member's interest."

#### 4. Allocation of Profits and Losses / Distributions
How money (e.g., from streams, syncs, merch) is shared—can be unequal.

**Sample Clause**:
"Profits and losses shall be allocated to Members in proportion to their Ownership Interests [or alternatively: special allocations, e.g., priority return to Passive Members]. Distributions of available cash shall be made [quarterly/annually] at the discretion of the Managers, first to cover taxes, then [pro rata / with preferred returns to investors up to X%]. No distributions shall be made if they would impair the Company's ability to pay debts."

#### 5. Voting Rights and Major Decisions
Protects passive investors on big issues while keeping day-to-day with managers.

**Sample Clause**:
"Day-to-day decisions are vested solely in the Managers. Major Decisions require approval by [e.g., 75% of Membership Interests], including: amending this Agreement, admitting new Members, selling substantial assets, incurring debt over [$X], dissolving the Company, or entering into agreements outside the ordinary course (e.g., major label partnerships or artist advances over [$Y]). Passive Members shall vote only on Major Decisions."

#### 6. Transfer of Membership Interests / Buy-Sell Provisions
Prevents unwanted transfers; useful for investor exits.

**Sample Clause**:
"No Member may transfer their Interest without the prior written consent of [Managers / majority of Members], except to family or trusts. The Company and other Members shall have a right of first refusal. Upon a Member's death, disability, or withdrawal, the remaining Members may purchase the Interest at fair market value (determined by appraisal)."

#### 7. Intellectual Property (Tailored for Music Label)
Addresses ownership of label assets like masters, trademarks.

**Sample Clause**:
"All intellectual property created or acquired in connection with the Company's business (including master recordings, artist contracts, trademarks, and label branding) shall be owned exclusively by the Company. Members contribute any pre-existing IP related to the label upon execution of this Agreement."

#### 8. Dissolution and Winding Up
What happens if the label ends.

**Sample Clause**:
"The Company shall dissolve upon [e.g., vote of 75% Interests, bankruptcy, or court order]. Upon dissolution, assets shall be used first to pay creditors, then distributed to Members in proportion to their positive Capital Accounts."

#### 9. Indemnification and Liability
Standard protection.

**Sample Clause**:
"The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Managers and Members from liabilities arising from Company activities, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct."

These clauses keep operations with active members while protecting passive investors and clarifying music-specific elements (e.g., IP). Start with a free template from reputable sources (e.g., Northwest Registered Agent or Rocket Lawyer manager-managed versions), insert these, and get it lawyer-reviewed—especially for tax treatment of passive income.

If you share your state, number of members, or specific concerns (e.g., preferred returns for investors), I can suggest more targeted refinements! 🎵
