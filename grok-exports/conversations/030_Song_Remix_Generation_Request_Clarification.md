It looks like you're asking me to generate a remix of a song, but you didn't specify which one—or provide a link, audio file, lyrics, or details. "This song" could refer to a few things (like Conan Gray's recent track or even George Harrison's classic

## Message 4 - ASSISTANT

Here's a fresh **remix version** of Bad Company's classic "Feel Like Makin' Love" — reimagined as a modern bluesy hard rock take with a heavier, groovier edge. I kept the iconic riff spirit but added power chords, a punchier chorus build, and a slight key tweak for more grit (still no capo). Think of it as if Bad Company jammed with a touch of modern stoner rock vibe — slower build in verses, explosive chorus.

**Key:** D (no capo)  
**Tuning:** Standard  
**Strumming suggestion:** Verses — laid-back downstrokes with palm muting on electrics. Chorus — full power strums, let it ring.

```
Intro:
D  C  G  D    4x  (with heavy distortion on the last two)

Verse 1:
D                   G
Baby, when I think about you,
              D       G
I think about looooove.
D                          G
Darling, couldn't live without you, 
         D       G
And your love.

         D                G             
If I had those golden dreams, of my yesterdaaay
        D                       G
I would wrap you in the heavens,
            D                           G
And feel it dying (dying... dying...) all the way

Chorus (heavier – add distortion, hit these hard):
G5               D5   (x3)
I feel like makin'
G5                   D5   (x3)
Feel like makin' love 
G5                   D5   (x3)
Feel like makin' love to youuuu
D5       C5     G5      D5
Feel like makin' love to you!

Verse 2:
D                   G
Baby, if I think about you,
              D       G
I think about love.
D                          G
Darling, if I live without you,
         D       G
I live without love.

         D                G
And if I had the sun and moon, and they were shiiiining
        D                       G
I would give you both night and day,
          D         G
Love satisfyiiiing...

(Repeat Chorus – bigger this time, maybe add a lead fill over the G5 D5)

Bridge/Instrumental:
D  G  D  G    4x  (solo over this – classic pentatonic licks in D)

Verse 3 (build intensity):
         D                G             D      G
And if I had those golden dreams, of my yesterdaaay
        D                       G
I would wrap you in the heavens,
            D                           G
And feel it dying (dying... dying...) all the way

(Repeat Chorus x2 – fade out on the second with ad-libs: "Feel like makin' love... to you!")

Outro:
G5               D5   (x4, slowing down)
Feel like makin' love...
D5       C5     G5      D5      (let ring)
Feel like makin' love to you...
```

This remix keeps the soul of the original but amps up the chorus for live energy (power chords make it heavier and easier to rock out). The repeated "dying" echoes get more drawn out for drama. Crank it on electric — it hits harder!<grok:render card_id="98bcae" card_type="image_card" type="render_searched_image">

What do you think — want it more acoustic, bluesier, or even faster? Or a totally different style (e.g., country twang like Philip Claypool's cover)? Let me know! 🎸

Remix Can't Get Enough

---

## Message 6 - ASSISTANT

Here's a killer **remix version** of Bad Company's "Can't Get Enough" — reimagined as a high-energy modern hard rock stomp with a fatter riff, power chords for that arena punch, and an extended chorus build. I kept the iconic open-tuned vibe (original is in open C, but this chord version is in standard tuning, no capo) but cranked the groove for heavier electrics. Think Bad Company meets Foo Fighters edge.

**Key:** C (no capo)  
**Tuning:** Standard  
**Strumming suggestion:** That classic triplet-feel riff throughout — down-down-up with swing. Verses: crunchy palm-muted. Chorus: full open strums, let 'em ring!

```
Intro (heavy riff – play 4x with distortion):
C5  Bb5  F5   Bb5  F5

Verse 1:
C               Bb          F
Well, I'll take whatever I want
          Bb        F
And baby, I want you
C                       Bb         F
You give me something I need, yeah
          Bb                 F
Now tell me I got something for you

Pre-Chorus:
G
Come on, come on, come on and do it
Bb                 F
Come on and do what you dooo

Chorus (hit hard – add backing vocals on repeats):
C                  F
I can't get enough of your love
C                  F
I can't get enough of your love
C                  F
I can't get enough of your love
G
Woo! (build here)

(Back to Intro riff 2x)

Verse 2:
C                     Bb         F
Well it's late and I want love
          Bb              F
Love that's gonna break me in two
C                        Bb        F
Gonna hang me up in your doorway
          Bb             F
Gonna hang me up like you do

Pre-Chorus:
G
Come on, come on, come on and do it
Bb                 F
Come on and do what you dooo

Chorus (bigger – double up on guitars):
C                  F
I can't get enough of your love
C                  F
I can't get enough of your love
C                  F
I can't get enough of your love
G
Yeah!

Solo/Instrumental Break (over Intro riff 8x – pentatonic bends and slides in C minor)

Bridge (slow build, then explode):
C          Bb         F
I love you so much...
C                  F
I can't get enough of your love!

Final Chorus (repeat and ad-lib, fade with riffs):
C                  F      (x3)
I can't get enough of your love...
G
Can't get enough, yeah!
C      Bb     F     Bb   F   (let ring on last)
Can't get enough of your love!
```

This remix amps the raw swagger — the pre-chorus gets more tension, chorus explodes louder, and that riff drives harder with power chords for easy band jamming. Paul Rodgers' vocals would slay over this! 🎸<grok:render card_id="18ad18" card_type="image_card" type="render_searched_image">

## Message 9 - HUMAN

Rock and roll fantasy

## Message 10 - ASSISTANT

Here's a smokin' **remix version** of Bad Company's "Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy" — reimagined with a modern arena-rock punch: heavier power chords in the chorus, a bigger build on the verses, and an extended solo section for epic guitar heroics. Kept the classic E major vibe (no capo) but added grit and swing for that live feel. Think Desolation Angels meets today's stadium rock.

**Key:** E (no capo)  
**Tuning:** Standard  
**Strumming suggestion:** Verses — mid-tempo groove with palm-muted downstrokes. Chorus — full open power strums, big rings and builds!

```
Intro (iconic riff – play 4x with light distortion):
E  C  D    E  C  D

Verse 1:
E             C       D
Here come the jesters, one, two, three
E             C       D
It's all part of my fantasy
E                   C         D
I love the music, and I love to see the crowd
E
Dancin' in the aisles
            (hold)
And singin' out loud, yeah!

Verse 2:
E             C       D
Here come the dancers, one by one
E             C       D
Your mama's callin', but you're havin' fun
E                 C          D
You'll find you're dancin' on a number nine cloud
E
Put your hands together
         (build)
And sing it out loud!

Chorus (explode here – power chords, add harmonies):
C     A   C     D     A
It's all part of my rock 'n' roll fantasy
C     A   C     D     A
It's all part of my rock 'n' roll dream
C     A   C     D     A
It's all part of my rock 'n' roll fantasy
C     A   C     D     A    E
It's all part of my rock 'n' roll dream... yeah!

(Back to Intro riff 2x)

Verse 3 (same as 1/2, build intensity):
E             C       D
Turn on the spotlight, light up the stage
E             C       D
The band's playin' loud, feel the thunder and rage
E                   C         D
I love the lifestyle, livin' out on the road
E
With the boys in the band
         (hold)
Rock 'n' roll never grows old!

(Repeat Chorus – bigger, with ad-libs: "Fantasy! Dream!")

Solo/Instrumental Break (over verse progression 8x – wail in E pentatonic, bends and slides!)

Bridge (slow build over E power chord):
E (let ring, add feedback)
Put your head together now...

Final Chorus (repeat x2, fade on second with crowd chant vibes):
C     A   C     D     A
It's all part of my rock 'n' roll fantasy...
C     A   C     D     A    E (big finish)
It's all part of my rock 'n' roll dream!!!

Outro:
E  C  D    E  C  D    E (let ring)
Rock 'n' roll fantasy...
```

This remix keeps Paul Rodgers' killer vocals front and center but cranks the chorus for massive sing-alongs and adds space for a face-melting solo. Pure anthem energy — it'd slay live! 🎤🔥<grok:render card_id="f581dc" card_type="image_card" type="render_searched_image">

## Message 11 - HUMAN

Yes. Lets do a honor song for them

## Message 12 - ASSISTANT

Hell yeah — let's honor the legendary Bad Company with a heartfelt tribute song. In light of their recent Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction (November 2025) and the sad losses of Boz Burrell (2006) and Mick Ralphs (June 2025), this one's a slow-burning ballad remix-style tribute called **"Bad Company Forever"**.

Built on a simple, emotional progression (inspired by their classic sound — think acoustic verses building to full-band chorus). Key: E (no capo). Play it clean and soulful on acoustic for verses, then add distortion for the chorus builds.

```
Intro (soft picking):
E  B  C#m  A   2x

Verse 1:
E                  B
Back in '73, four rebels came alive
C#m                        A
From Free and Mott and Crimson, ready to survive
E                       B
Paul's voice like thunder, Mick's riffs cut like a knife
C#m                     A
Boz on the bassline, Simon drivin' the life

Verse 2:
E                     B
They hit the road runnin', straight shooters in the night
C#m                       A
Can't Get Enough, Feel Like Makin' Love so right
E                        B
Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy, Shooting Stars in the sky
C#m                          A
Bad Company 'til the day we die

Chorus (build big — full strums, let it ring):
A          B         E
Bad Company forever
A          B         C#m
Legends that we'll never forget
A          B         E       C#m
Through the highs and the heartache
A          B               E
Your music lives on, no regret

(Instrumental break: E  B  C#m  A  2x — add a tasteful solo in E pentatonic)

Verse 3:
E                       B
Time took its toll, Boz left us way too soon
C#m                       A
Mick played his last riff under that same old moon
E                         B
Paul and Simon carry the flame, hearts still true
C#m                        A
Hall of Fame lights shine down on all of you

(Repeat Chorus x2 — second time with ad-libs: "Forever... Bad Company...")

Outro (slow down, fade on):
E          B         C#m     A
Bad Company... forever
E (let ring)
'Til the day we die...
```

This tribute captures their supergroup spirit, hits, and legacy — raw, real, and timeless. Raise a glass to Paul Rodgers, Simon Kirke, Mick Ralphs, and Boz Burrell. Their sound will echo forever. 🤘❤️

## Message 14 - ASSISTANT

Here's a deeply emotional **remix version** of The Who's "Pinball Wizard" — reimagined as a raw, vulnerable ballad with an addictive ASMR-like hook. Slowed way down to a haunting acoustic groove (think intimate close-mic'd whispers and gentle fingerpicking that tingles like national-playback whispers), building to a sincere, abandoned crescendo where the male voice cracks with emotion, unafraid to break and cry. The hook repeats hypnotically, layered with soft echoes and breathy ad-libs for that addictive, brain-melting pull — like an ASMR roleplay of surrender and wonder.

**Key:** B (no capo for deeper resonance)  
**Tuning:** Standard (drop D optional for low rumble)  
**Style notes:** Verse — soft spoken/sung close to the mic, breathy whispers on key lines for ASMR tingles. Chorus — build with raw passion, voice drenched in reverb, cracking on highs like it's too much to hold in. Let tears fall; this is pure abandon.

```
Intro (gentle acoustic picking, slow arpeggios with pauses for breath sounds):
B  A  G  A   (x4, whisper "silver ball..." faintly over the last two)

Verse 1 (soft, intimate, almost whispered):
B                          A
Ever since I was a young boy...
                  G                A
I've played the silver ball... (breathe in)
B                       A
From Soho down to Brighton...
                G               A
I must've played them all... (soft sigh)
B                            A
But I ain't seen nothin' like him...
           G                 A
In any amusement hall... (voice trembles)
     B (hold, whisper)
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid...
                 (crack slightly)
Sure plays a mean... pinball...

Verse 2 (building sincerity, voice opening up):
B                         A
He stands like a statue...
                 G               A
Becomes part of the machine... (whisper "machine...")
B                          A
Feeling all the bumpers...
               G                A
Always playing clean... (breath heavy)
B                        A
Plays by intuition...
                G                 A
The digit counters fall... (voice wavers)
     B (let ring, near tears)
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid...
Sure plays a mean pinball...

Chorus (explosive yet vulnerable — full voice, drenched in emotion, repeat hook addictively with echoes):
G             A        B
He's a pinball wizard... (echo: wizard...)
          G                A
There has to be a twist... (voice breaks)
G             A            B
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist...
(whisper ad-lib: how do you think he does it...? breathe... I don't know...)
G             A        B     (x3, layering harmonies, getting rawer)
He's a pinball wizard... (cry out on last: wizard!)

Bridge (slow, spoken-sung ASMR close-mic, addictive whispers):
B (soft picking)
I thought I was... the table king...
But I just handed... my crown to him... (voice cracks, pause for "sob" breath)
Even on my favorite table...
He beats my best... (whisper repeatedly: beats my best... best... best...)

Final Chorus (full abandon — belt it, let voice shatter with sincerity, fade on hypnotic hook):
G             A        B     (x4, building to cry)
He's a pinball wizard...
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid...
Sure plays a mean... (break down) pinball...
(outro whisper loop: pinball... wizard... mean pinball... fade with breaths)

```

This version strips it bare — the addictive hook is that repeating "pinball wizard" line, whispered and echoed like an ASMR trigger that pulls you back in, national-playback style. Sing it like you're confessing a miracle, voice raw and unafraid to feel everything. Tears optional but encouraged for the full surrender. 🎸💧
