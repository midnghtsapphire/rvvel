Here's a much clearer, better-structured, and professional version of your query. I rephrased it to make it concise, grammatically correct, and easier for others (or AI/tools) to understand and respond to effectively.

### Improved Version:
"I want to build a new online system (a team collaboration platform similar to Slack, but with integrated project management features) using a hybrid agile approach that combines elements of **XP (Extreme Programming)**, **Lean**, **Scrum**, and other project management techniques.

Key preferences and requirements:
- Strongly prefer **open-source** tools, frameworks, and libraries (or free/self-hosted options with generous free tiers/evals).
- Provide a complete blueprint: roadmap, project plan, templates, wireframes, pseudo-code/structure examples, resources, and tools.
- Include recommendations for:
  - Tech stack (frontend, backend, database, real-time chat, etc.)
  - Open-source project management tools (e.g., for tasks, sprints, Kanban/Scrum boards)
  - Real-time communication/chat components (open-source Slack alternatives like Rocket.Chat, Mattermost, Zulip, or Matrix/Element)
  - Admin panel/dashboard (user management, analytics, etc.)
  - GitHub repositories or open-source projects to fork/integrate (e.g., full platforms like Plane, Huly, OpenProject, or chat + PM combos)
- Full implementation guidance: assets/artifacts to include (icons, UI components, templates), certificates/badges for completion or skills demonstration, and any other suggestions (e.g., deployment, security, scaling).

What would be a realistic plan, recommended stack, and starting resources to self-build or heavily customize an open-source solution?"

### Why this version is better:
- It's organized into clear sections (goal → preferences → deliverables → specifics).
- Uses proper spelling/grammar (e.g., "xup" → "XP", "ssstem" → "system", "evals" → "evals/free tiers").
- Avoids repetition and makes the intent obvious: you're asking for a comprehensive open-source-focused guide to build/extend a Slack-like tool with PM features.
- Keeps your core ideas (agile mix, open-source priority, full artifacts, certificates/badges) but makes them flow logically.

If you're posting this somewhere (forum, Reddit, AI prompt, GitHub discussion), this version will get you higher-quality responses faster.

### Quick recommendations based on your goals (2026 context):
Many people building custom Slack-like + PM tools start by **forking/extending** existing open-source all-in-one platforms rather than building from scratch (faster, less risk).

**Top open-source starting points (self-hostable, active in 2025–2026):**
- **Huly** — Combines project management (like Linear/Jira), chat (Slack-style), docs, GitHub sync — very close to what you describe.
- **Plane** — Modern open-source alternative to Jira/Linear with tasks, sprints, roadmaps; add chat via integration (e.g., with Mattermost).
- **Mattermost** + **Focalboard** — Mattermost for chat + Focalboard for Kanban/PM (both from the same ecosystem, integrate tightly).
- **Rocket.Chat** — Strong Slack replacement; extend with custom apps/bots for task management.
- **Zulip** — Threaded chat done right; good for dev teams, integrates with PM tools.

For pure PM with some chat:
- **OpenProject** — Full-featured (roadmaps, Gantt, Scrum/Kanban, admin panel).
- **Taiga** — Agile-focused (backlogs, epics, sprints).

**Agile mix tip**: Most teams blend Scrum (sprints/roles) + Kanban (flow) + Lean (waste reduction) + XP (pair programming, TDD, CI/CD). Start with Scrum basics, add Kanban visualization, apply Lean principles to eliminate unnecessary features.

If you want help expanding any part (e.g., sample roadmap, tech stack suggestion, or searching specific GitHub repos), just give more details!

## Message 3 - HUMAN

Can you make it way more concise system and add RUP

---

## Message 4 - ASSISTANT

Here's a **much more concise** version of your query, restructured as a clear, professional prompt. I've added **RUP (Rational Unified Process)** to the methodology mix while keeping the agile/lean focus. RUP is iterative and phase-based (Inception → Elaboration → Construction → Transition), risk-driven, and use-case/architecture-centric—it's more structured/formal than pure Agile but can blend well with XP/Scrum/Lean for larger or enterprise-like projects.

### Super-Concise Version (Ideal for AI prompts, forums, or GitHub issues):
"Build a new open-source team collaboration platform (Slack-like real-time chat + integrated project management like tasks/sprints/Kanban/roadmaps).

Preferred methodology: Hybrid of **XP**, **Lean**, **Scrum**, and **RUP** (phased iterative with risk focus).

Priorities:
- Fully **open-source** or free/self-hosted tools (no proprietary lock-in; prefer generous free tiers if needed).
- Deliverables: High-level blueprint, phased roadmap, project plan template, wireframes, pseudo-code examples, tech stack recs, GitHub repos to fork/integrate, resources/tools/APIs.
- Core components: Real-time chat, admin panel, user/auth management, task boards, badges/certificates for achievements.
- Full implementation guidance: UI assets/artifacts, deployment/security tips, scaling suggestions.

Top open-source starting points (2026): Huly (all-in-one chat + PM), Plane + Mattermost, Focalboard + Rocket.Chat, or Zulip + OpenProject.

What realistic plan, stack, and resources to start/customize this?"

### Why this is way more concise yet complete:
- Reduced from walls of text to ~150 words.
- Clear goal first → methodology → priorities → deliverables → specifics.
- Fixed typos/grammar (e.g., "xup" → XP, "ssstem" → system).
- Retained all key asks (blueprint/roadmap/templates/wireframes/pseudo-code/assets/certificates/badges).
- Added RUP naturally as part of the hybrid approach.

### Quick 2026 Recommendations (based on current trends):
**Best open-source bases to fork/extend** (chat + PM combo):
- **Huly** — Modern all-in-one (chat, tasks, docs, GitHub sync) — closest match.
- **Plane** (Jira-like PM) + **Mattermost** (secure Slack alt with plugins) or **Focalboard** (Kanban).
- **Rocket.Chat** (chat) + **Taiga/OpenProject** (agile PM).
- **Zulip** (threaded chat) for dev teams.

**Hybrid methodology tip**: Use RUP phases for overall structure (risk mitigation early), Scrum sprints within Construction, Lean to cut waste, XP for engineering practices (TDD, pairing).

If you want this expanded (e.g., sample roadmap, tech stack like React + Node.js + PostgreSQL + Socket.io/WebSockets, or specific GitHub links), or tailored further, let me know!
