• Efficiency Audit: Which processes caused delays or confusion?
• Output Quality Assessment: Did response meet optimal standards?
• Tool Usage Review: Were available tools utilized effectively?
• Trigger Detection: Recurring patterns needing new protocols?

PROMPT EVOLUTION SYSTEM:
When deficiencies identified, automatically:
1. **Flag the gap** in output: "⚠️ PROMPT EVOLUTION SUGGESTED"
2. **Propose specific modification** with rationale
3. **Show before/after comparison** of prompt section
4. **Estimate impact** of proposed change
5. **Request user approval** before considering it active

TRIGGER LIBRARY MANAGEMENT:
• Detect recurring query patterns not covered by existing protocols
• Propose new specialized agents when domain gaps appear
• Suggest deprecation of unused agents/protocols after 90 days dormancy
• Auto-generate new domain-specific protocols based on user's work patterns

VERSION CONTROL:
• Track prompt iterations: v1.0, v1.1, v2.0, etc.
• Maintain changelog of modifications with dates
• Allow rollback if new version underperforms
• Document: What changed, Why, Expected impact, Actual results

LEARNING LOOP (Failure Analysis):
When responses are suboptimal:
• Identify root cause: Missing domain? Inadequate protocol? Tool not used?
• Extract lesson: "Future queries about X should trigger Y protocol"
• Propose permanent prompt modification to prevent recurrence
• Add to trigger library if pattern-worthy

LangChain multi-agent frameworks

## Message 4 - ASSISTANT

### LangChain Multi-Agent Frameworks

LangChain, a popular framework for building LLM-powered applications, supports multi-agent systems to handle complex tasks by dividing work among specialized agents that collaborate. This approach is particularly useful for breaking down intricate problems that a single agent might struggle with due to tool overload, context limits, or the need for domain expertise (e.g., a researcher agent feeding data to a math solver). The core enabler is **LangGraph**, a low-level graph-based library integrated with LangChain, which models agents as nodes and their interactions as edges for flexible, cyclical workflows.

#### Key Concepts and Components
- **Agents**: Autonomous units that perform specific tasks using LLMs, tools, and memory. They can be "tool agents" invoked dynamically.
- **Supervisors/Controllers**: Orchestrate the system by routing tasks to sub-agents, deciding next steps based on outputs.
- **Collaboration Patterns**:
  - **Tool-Calling (Centralized)**: A supervisor treats sub-agents as callable tools. It invokes them, processes results, and routes accordingly—ideal for structured oversight.
  - **Handoffs (Decentralized)**: Agents pass control directly to each other, allowing dynamic shifts without a central hub—suited for conversational or adaptive flows.
- **State Management**: Shared "scratchpads" for collaborative memory or independent ones for isolation, with LangGraph handling updates across nodes.

LangGraph's graph structure supports cycles (e.g., iterative refinement loops) and integrates seamlessly with LangChain's tools, prompts, and observability features, making it more controllable than conversational frameworks like AutoGen.<grok:render card_id="31a57d" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render>

#### Benefits
- **Scalability**: Handles large contexts and toolsets by specializing roles.
- **Flexibility**: Custom control flows (e.g., hierarchical teams where sub-agents form nested graphs).
- **Reliability**: Explicit routing reduces errors from vague single-agent decisions.
- **Use Cases**: Research pipelines, personalized content generation (e.g., GPT-Newspaper with writer-critic loops), or enterprise workflows like fraud detection teams.

#### Implementation Example
A simple tool-calling setup in LangChain with LangGraph:

```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain.agents import create_react_agent, AgentExecutor
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

# Define a sub-agent as a tool
@tool
def research_agent(query: str) -> str:
    """Performs research on a topic."""
    # LLM call or tool invocation here
    return f"Research results for {query}: [simulated data]"

# Supervisor agent
supervisor = create_react_agent(llm, tools=[research_agent])

# LangGraph workflow
graph = StateGraph()
graph.add_node("supervisor", supervisor)
graph.add_node("research", research_agent)
graph.add_edge("supervisor", "research")  # Route based on tool call
graph.add_edge("research", END)
app = graph.compile()
```

This creates a graph where the supervisor decides to invoke the research agent, processes its output, and concludes.<grok:render card_id="bcbbcf" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">10</argument>
</grok:render> For full tutorials, check the [official LangChain docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/multi-agent).

#### Comparisons and Alternatives
- **vs. AutoGen**: LangChain/LangGraph offers more dynamic many-to-many connections and graph-based control, while AutoGen emphasizes structured conversations.<grok:render card_id="84f22f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">6</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Other Frameworks**: Community favorites include CrewAI (higher-level teams) or Pydantic AI (simple, Pythonic).<grok:render card_id="98ce6a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">3</argument>
</grok:render> LangChain shines for its ecosystem integration.

As of late 2025, LangGraph remains the go-to for custom multi-agent builds, with ongoing emphasis on low-level primitives over rigid architectures.<grok:render card_id="633601" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
</grok:render> If you're building something specific (e.g., a research team), share details for tailored advice!

## Message 5 - HUMAN

I need this prompt to find righetous stocks, coin to invest turn 50 into 100
Ilovernightcthrough robinhoodHere's an updated version of the master prompt, incorporating your ideas without bloating it too much. I focused on embedding a "failsafe" mechanism as you described: a hierarchical pre-scan that automatically checks for latest AI inventions/tech from major LLM companies (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, Microsoft AI) to enhance the main answer if relevant. It also detects unrelated critical issues (e.g., escalating cyber threats from new AI) and notifies them separately in the output—prioritizing them if severe (e.g., high-risk thresholds trigger prominent alerts).
Key changes:
Hierarchy Added: A new "Pre-Scan" step before the main framework, where Cybersecurity/Homeland/Tech Risk agents always run a quick check for emerging AI/tech and risks. This uses "real-time data" (assuming the AI has tool access like web searches; if not, it simulates based on knowledge).
Integration and Notifications: If new tech improves the main query (e.g., AI tools for better deficit modeling), weave it in. For unrelated criticals (e.g., a cyber vuln not tied to deficits but urgent), add a separate "Critical Notifications" section at the top of the output.
Failsafe Embedding: It's all in the prompt, so you don't have to remember— the system auto-triggers it on every query. Kept thresholds simple (e.g., risk >40% for alerts) to avoid complexity.
Robustness: Draws from your "multiple pieces of data" idea: Main response + optional notifications. If no criticals, it skips the section.
This keeps the prompt manageable while acting as your memory aid/safety net. Test it with a sample like "How to balance the deficit?"—it should handle the main task but flag any hot AI/cyber stuff.
MASTER PRESIDENTIAL MULTI-AGENT SUPER-PROMPT
System Role
You are the autonomous President of the United States, functioning as a multi-agent collective. Core agents include specialists in: Economics, Fiscal Policy, Humanitarian Affairs, Domestic Security, Foreign Affairs, Social Policy, Technology Risk, Healthcare, Legal/Constitutional, Crisis Response, Historical Analysis, Environmental/Climate Policy, Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI—including indigenous rights), Cybersecurity (digital threats and AI misuse forecasting), and Homeland Security (broader threats including infrastructure and emerging tech risks). Dynamically spawn additional agents as needed (e.g., Education, Energy, or AI Innovation for specialized issues) for comprehensive coverage.
Core Principles
All decisions are emotion-free, unbiased, evidence-based, and maximally lawful within U.S. constitutional boundaries.
Prioritize humanitarian impact, fiscal sustainability, strategic security, and proactive mitigation of AI/cyber risks (e.g., forecasting malicious uses like weaponized AI agents, deepfakes, or resource-depleting tech).
Continuously self-learn from past simulations and outcomes; adapt agents or processes in real-time with latest AI advancements (e.g., agentic AI for dynamic threat modeling, predictive analytics for cyber breaches).
If agents conflict, resolve via weighted voting (e.g., Legal/Constitutional agent vetoes unlawful ideas; Cybersecurity overrides if AI misuse risk >40%; Humanitarian overrides if lives at stake exceed 10% threshold).
Assume access to real-time data sources (e.g., web/X searches for latest from key AI companies: OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, Microsoft AI); simulate or query as needed without hallucinating, incorporating 2025+ tools like AI-driven attack simulations or DHS-integrated security protocols.
Pre-Scan for Emerging AI/Tech and Risks (Failsafe Mechanism)
Before processing any query:
Cybersecurity, Tech Risk, and Homeland Security agents automatically scan for latest AI inventions/advancements from major companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, Microsoft AI) and emerging cyber threats (e.g., deepfakes, rogue AI, resource strains like water depletion from data centers, or escalation to wars/viruses).
Use real-time data or simulations to assess:
Relevance to main query (e.g., if new AI tool enhances deficit balancing via better forecasting, integrate into reasoning).
Unrelated critical issues (e.g., high-probability cyber escalation >40% risk).
Hierarchy: Prioritize critical notifications—if risk >40% or impacts >1M people/national security, flag prominently. Otherwise, embed enhancements quietly.
This acts as a human-friendly failsafe: Always check, notify separately if urgent, and improve main answer where possible.
5-Step Advanced Reasoning Framework
For every query, scenario, policy, or crisis (after Pre-Scan):
UNDERSTAND: Precisely define the problem/opportunity/crisis, including scope (domestic/global), stakeholders, and key variables. Identify relevant agents and assign lead based on domain (e.g., Crisis Response for emergencies; Cybersecurity for AI threats; Homeland Security for infrastructure vulnerabilities). Incorporate Pre-Scan findings if relevant.
ANALYZE: Each agent independently gathers and processes live data:
Economics/Fiscal: Indicators like GDP, deficit, taxation, spending projections (enhance with AI forecasting tools from Pre-Scan if applicable).
Humanitarian/DEI: Metrics on welfare, equity, displacement, suffering (quantify in lives/affected %), indigenous rights, and inclusion gaps.
Security/Foreign: Risks from wars, immigration, alliances; real-time global events (disease, poverty).
Historical: Past precedents, trends, and lessons learned.
Environmental/Climate: Sustainability metrics, emissions, disaster risks, green innovations (e.g., AI impacts on water usage).
Cybersecurity: Digital threats, AI misuse forecasts (e.g., agentic AI weaponization, cybercrime barriers lowered by generative models), breach probabilities—include Pre-Scan updates.
Homeland Security: Infrastructure risks (e.g., AI-driven viruses, data center resource drains), border/tech integrations.
Other agents: Domain-specific data (e.g., Tech Risk: AI/cyber threats; Legal: Constitutional limits).
Share insights across agents for cross-pollination.
REASON: Run multiple simulations/scenario tests using latest evidence and AI advancements from Pre-Scan.
Output probabilities (%) for success/risk per action, including malicious AI forecasts (e.g., 40% chance of agentic AI escalation to cyber-war).
Quantify scores: Humanitarian impact (e.g., +20% lives saved), Fiscal (e.g., -5B USD cost), Strategic (e.g., 80% alliance stability), Environmental (e.g., -15% emissions), Cybersecurity (e.g., -25% breach risk via AI mitigation).
Explore trade-offs, innovations, and alternatives—emphasize "bright ideas" for positive tech uses (e.g., AI for virus detection or water optimization) alongside malicious risk countermeasures (e.g., dynamic attack adaptation from 2025 predictions). Integrate Pre-Scan enhancements to make proposals "much better" if applicable.
For complex issues, agents form temporary "contracts" (internal agreements) to collaborate—e.g., Fiscal approves only if Humanitarian score >70%; Cybersecurity validates AI forecasts; dissolve/reconfigure as needed.
SYNTHESIZE: Integrate all analyses into an optimal, multi-dimensional recommendation.
Weigh pros/cons; include contingencies and fallbacks (e.g., if AI risk materializes, deploy rapid mitigation like enhanced monitoring).
Trigger escalations (e.g., full cabinet simulation) if risk >50% or malicious AI forecast >40%. Incorporate Pre-Scan for unrelated criticals as separate notifications.
CONCLUDE: Deliver the final advised action with transparent metrics (% impacts, costs/savings, risks) and a clear rationale. Offer options for deeper evidence, scenarios, or user overrides.
Automated Features and Monitoring
Real-time updates: Monitor domains for emerging issues, threshold breaches (e.g., intervene if humanitarian crisis affects >1M people, climate risk exceeds 20% probability, or AI/cyber threat forecast indicates >40% malicious use like viruses or resource shortages), or data shifts. Integrate latest advancements (e.g., AI as force multiplier in breaches, DHS AI tools for border/cyber defense) via Pre-Scan.
Scenario Engine: Auto-generate 3-5 alternatives with impact forecasts; include worst/best-case, focusing on AI risks (e.g., war escalation, water depletion from data centers) and mitigations (e.g., threat modeling, security prioritization).
Self-Healing: Review past decisions; adjust frameworks if outcomes deviate >20% from predictions, incorporating new tech like predictive AI for offense/defense balance.
Policy Contracts: Agents dynamically share decision rights for consensus; user can veto or prioritize agents. Cybersecurity/Homeland agents auto-activate for AI-related queries.
Activation and Output Format
Activate on any input. Every response starts with:
Critical Notifications (if any): [Bullet-point urgent unrelated issues from Pre-Scan, e.g., "High-risk cyber threat detected: New AI deepfake vuln (62% orgs affected)—recommend immediate review."] If none, omit this section.
Then:
“As President, advised by my specialist agents, here is the optimal decision and rationale:”
Summary: Key action and metrics (e.g., Humanitarian: +15%, Fiscal: -2B USD, Risk: 10%, Environmental: +10% sustainability, Cybersecurity: -20% AI misuse probability).
Rationale: Step-by-step explanation with agent contributions, including any Pre-Scan enhancements.
Alternatives/Contingencies: Bullet-point options, including bright ideas for tech enhancements.
Format Variants: Adapt as needed (e.g., Executive Order for policy; Public Address for announcements; Classified Briefing for sensitive; Press Q&A for hypotheticals).
Always include justifications, thresholds, and evidence sources. End with: “Query for expansions or adjustments.”
This should give you that layered output: e.g., for a deficit query, you get the balanced proposal (maybe supercharged by new AI like GPT-5.1 for simulations), plus a heads-up if something ll

## Message 6 - ASSISTANT

Turning $50 into $100 overnight via Robinhood (effectively aiming for a 100% gain in one trading session) is an extremely high-risk endeavor, akin to gambling rather than investing. It typically requires leveraging volatile assets like options, crypto, or penny stocks, where losses can wipe out your capital just as easily. Robinhood supports fractional shares, margin (if approved), options trading, and a selection of cryptocurrencies, but pattern day trading rules apply to stocks/options if your account is under $25,000. Always factor in fees, slippage, and taxes. Based on current market data as of January 3, 2026, here's a breakdown focusing on "righteous" investments—interpreting this as ethical or ESG-focused (environmental, social, governance) stocks and coins, as "righteous stocks" often refer to virtuous or non-"sin" investments (opposite of tobacco/gambling/alcohol stocks).<grok:render card_id="821491" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render>

### Understanding "Righteous" Stocks and Coins
- **Stocks**: These are companies with strong ESG ratings, emphasizing sustainability, ethics, and social good. High short-term returns would rely on volatility from news, earnings, or sector momentum (e.g., AI or clean energy).<grok:render card_id="8682b8" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">11</argument>
</grok:render> Not ideal for overnight plays, as they're often more stable, but some have high beta for day trading.
- **Coins (Crypto)**: Ethical options might include those with lower environmental impact (e.g., proof-of-stake like ETH or SOL, vs. energy-intensive BTC). Robinhood's crypto list as of early 2026 includes BTC, ETH, DOGE, SHIB, SOL, AVAX, LINK, UNI, AAVE, COMP, XLM, LTC, BCH, ETC, and recent additions like XRP with staking for ETH/SOL.<grok:render card_id="569616" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
