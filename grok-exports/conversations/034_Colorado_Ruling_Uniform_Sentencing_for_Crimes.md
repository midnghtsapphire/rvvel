The Colorado Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling on December 22, 2025, in the consolidated original proceedings titled *In re People v. Camp* (Case No. 24SA276) and *In re People v. Simons* (Case Nos. 24SA308 and 24SA309), holding that home-rule municipalities cannot impose harsher penalties than state law allows when a local ordinance criminalizes the exact same conduct as a state statute.<grok:render card_id="a9e2ff" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render> This applies specifically to non-felony offenses, such as certain misdemeanors and petty offenses, where state sentencing caps were established under the Misdemeanor Reform Act of 2021 (codified in sections 18-1.3-501(1)(a.5) for misdemeanors and 18-1.3-503(1.5) for petty offenses).<grok:render card_id="69b3ed" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render>

### Background and Cases Involved
The ruling arose from two separate cases:
- **Aleah Michelle Camp**: Charged in 2022 with theft of goods valued under $300 in Westminster Municipal Court. Under the city's ordinance, she faced up to 364 days in jail and a $2,650 fine. The equivalent state offense carried a maximum of 10 days in jail and a $300 fine.<grok:render card_id="c8c784" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Danielle Ashley Simons**: Charged in 2023 with motor vehicle trespass in Aurora Municipal Court. The municipal penalties were up to 364 days in jail and a $2,650 fine, compared to 120 days in jail and a $750 fine under state law.<grok:render card_id="3f9e82" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>

Both defendants argued that the harsher municipal sentences violated state preemption and equal protection principles, as they could face significantly longer jail time simply based on whether they were prosecuted in municipal or state court.<grok:render card_id="c1c3a8" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">20</argument>
</grok:render> The court did not address the equal protection claims, focusing instead on preemption.<grok:render card_id="eb0497" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>

### Key Holdings
- **Preemption Applies**: The court classified the regulation of penalties for low-level criminal conduct as a matter of "mixed statewide and local concern." This is because the Colorado Constitution grants home-rule cities (like Westminster and Aurora) authority over local matters (Art. XX, § 6) while the state retains power over statewide issues (Art. III, § 1).<grok:render card_id="aa8145" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Operational Conflict**: In areas of mixed concern, municipal law is preempted if it materially conflicts with state law. Here, municipal ordinances allowing penalties above state caps "authorize what state law forbids," undermining the state's interest in uniform maximum penalties for non-felony offenses across Colorado.<grok:render card_id="830542" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render> The court distinguished this from prior cases (e.g., *Quintana v. Edgewater Municipal Court* (1972), *City & County of Denver v. Martin* (1973), and *Wade v. Cass Municipal Court* (1988)), where no such conflict existed because the conduct or penalties differed.<grok:render card_id="d78f46" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Scope**: Municipalities can still prosecute violations of their ordinances in municipal courts and set penalties up to—but not exceeding—state caps for identical conduct. They can exceed state caps only if no equivalent state offense exists.<grok:render card_id="635251" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="754b9b" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render>

The opinion was authored by Chief Justice Monica M. Márquez.<grok:render card_id="0bf2d5" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">0</argument>
</grok:render>

### Reasoning
The court emphasized the Misdemeanor Reform Act's goal of promoting consistent, proportionate sentencing statewide to reduce disparities in outcomes for minor crimes.<grok:render card_id="da1e0e" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render> Factors in the mixed-concern analysis included:
- The need for uniformity (supported by the Act, though not absolute).
- Extraterritorial impacts (e.g., non-residents facing varying penalties in different cities).
- Historical regulation by both state and local governments.
- Constitutional commitments to shared authority.

No express or implied preemption was found in the Act itself, as it doesn't explicitly address municipal powers. However, the operational conflict was clear: harsher local sentences create a "patchwork" that impedes statewide consistency.<grok:render card_id="968773" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render>

### Implications
- **For Municipal Courts**: Hundreds of municipal courts in Colorado must now align their sentencing for identical offenses with state caps, potentially reducing average jail times (previously up to five times higher in municipal courts for minor crimes).<grok:render card_id="f594de" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render> This could lead to policy revisions in cities like Westminster and Aurora.
- **Broader Effects**: The ruling builds on 2021 reforms aimed at decriminalizing low-level offenses and may influence future legislation. For instance, a 2025 bill (House Bill 1147) to address sentencing disparities was vetoed by Gov. Jared Polis, who suggested the court's decision could guide reforms.<grok:render card_id="566532" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">19</argument>
</grok:render>
- **Ongoing Cases**: The court made the orders to show cause absolute and remanded the Camp and Simons cases for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.<grok:render card_id="734d0f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>

## Message 3 - HUMAN

Is there data on how many home-rule,statuatory, towns exceeded state sentencing. Law suits?

## Message 4 - ASSISTANT

Yes, there is some data and reporting on this topic, though it's not comprehensive or exhaustive—likely because the Colorado Supreme Court ruling is very recent (December 22, 2025), and systematic statewide audits of municipal codes pre-ruling aren't publicly detailed in available sources. I'll break it down by category based on legal analyses, news reports, and court documents. Note that the issue primarily affects home-rule municipalities (which have constitutional authority to adopt their own charters and ordinances), as statutory towns and cities are more strictly bound by state statutes and generally cannot deviate in ways that exceed state sentencing caps for identical offenses. Colorado has approximately 103 home-rule municipalities and 169 statutory ones (total 272), with over 200 municipal courts statewide, but not all handle criminal matters or had exceeding penalties.

### Data on Home-Rule Municipalities Exceeding State Sentencing Caps
Home-rule cities could (and often did) maintain ordinances with harsher penalties than the state caps set by the 2021 Misdemeanor Reform Act (SB 21-271), which reduced maximum jail time for low-level misdemeanors and petty offenses (e.g., 10 days max for petty theft under $300, vs. prior municipal norms of up to 364 days). Sources describe this as widespread among home-rule entities, but no precise statewide count exists in public reports. Instead, we have:

- **Qualitative Descriptions and Estimates**: Multiple sources refer to "many" home-rule cities retaining harsher punishments post-2021, creating a "patchwork" of disparities. For example, a legal commentary notes that "many home-rule cities... left intact municipal codes authorizing far harsher punishments—up to 364 days in jail and fines of $2,650—for the same conduct."<grok:render card_id="1aa94f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">41</argument>
</grok:render> A Denver Post analysis of major cities similarly highlights that potential jail sentences in municipal courts "often far outpace Colorado’s state sentencing limits," with examples from at least 10 cities.<grok:render card_id="970a2e" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render>
  
- **Specific Examples and Scale**: 
  - Aurora (home-rule): Up to 364 days for retail theft or trespassing (vs. state max of 10 days for petty offenses); also mandated minimums like 90 days for repeat shoplifting.<grok:render card_id="086c93" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render>
  - Denver (home-rule): Up to 300 days for retail theft or trespassing (vs. 10 days state).<grok:render card_id="843907" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render>
  - Westminster (home-rule): Up to 364 days and $2,650 fine for theft under $300 (vs. state 10 days/$300); described as 36 times the jail and 9 times the fine of state equivalents.<grok:render card_id="66745d" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render>
  - Pueblo (home-rule): Strengthened ordinances post-2021 with mandatory jail for low-level offenses; one amicus brief notes Pueblo's court "illegally sentenced extremely vulnerable" defendants beyond state caps.<grok:render card_id="03b827" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">45</argument>
</grok:render>
  - Rifle (home-rule): Up to 180 days for theft under $100 (vs. 10 days state).<grok:render card_id="ca2ee8" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render>
  - Longmont (home-rule): 30-day sentences for trespassing violations (vs. 10 days state).<grok:render card_id="439f8f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render>
  - Other mentions: Cities like Lakewood and Alamosa have been flagged in older ACLU reports for broader abusive practices in municipal courts, including disproportionate sentencing tied to poverty, though not directly tied to post-2021 caps.<grok:render card_id="c1fd80" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">47</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="a7b918" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">52</argument>
</grok:render>

- **Quantitative Insights from Analyses**: A Denver Post review of 468 theft and trespassing convictions in 10 major home-rule cities (pre-ruling) found municipal defendants served an average of 5-6 days in jail—up to 5 times more than in state courts for similar minor crimes.<grok:render card_id="f0a84d" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render> No source tallies the exact total, but the Colorado Municipal League (representing cities) argued in briefs that allowing exceedances was common practice under home-rule authority.<grok:render card_id="846ff3" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render> The Supreme Court opinion itself doesn't quantify but implies widespread impact by classifying penalty regulation as a "mixed statewide and local concern" to promote uniformity.<grok:render card_id="ab075e" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">39</argument>
</grok:render>

### Data on Statutory Towns Exceeding State Sentencing Caps
There is no data indicating statutory towns exceeded state caps, as they lack the constitutional home-rule powers (Article XX, § 6) to adopt independent ordinances conflicting with state law in this area. Statutory municipalities must adhere to state statutes for criminal matters, so their penalties align by default. The ruling and related discussions focus exclusively on home-rule entities like Westminster and Aurora.<grok:render card_id="7221f6" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">39</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="543e2d" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render> If any statutory town deviated, it would likely be rare and unlawful, but no examples appear in reports.

### Lawsuits and Legal Challenges
Yes, there have been several lawsuits and legal actions challenging harsher municipal penalties, often on grounds of state preemption, equal protection (Colorado Constitution), and racial/economic disparities. These are mostly individual cases or petitions rather than large class actions, but they've driven the recent ruling. Key ones include:

- **In re People v. Camp (Westminster, 2024SA276)**: Challenged theft penalties 36x harsher than state; ACLU filed amicus briefs arguing statewide interest in eliminating disparities (e.g., racial impacts from SB 21-271 reforms).<grok:render card_id="dcfedd" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">40</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="702980" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">44</argument>
</grok:render> Consolidated with Simons cases.
  
- **In re People v. Simons (Aurora, 2024SA308/309)**: Trespassing penalties up to 364 days vs. state 10-120 days; focused on preemption.<grok:render card_id="067a39" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">39</argument>
</grok:render> These led to the unanimous Supreme Court ruling prohibiting exceedances.

- **City of Rifle v. Mobley (2023SA289)**: Couple faced 180 days for theft in municipal court vs. 10 days state; appealed on equal protection, arguing identical conduct punished differently. Dismissed in December 2024 after Rifle aligned ordinances with state caps and dropped charges.<grok:render card_id="8528be" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">39</argument>
</grok:render><grok:render card_id="97d0e4" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render>

- **Aurora Trespassing Motion (July 2024)**: Challenged 364-day max vs. state 10 days.<grok:render card_id="2ba204" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render>

- **Longmont Probation Violation/Trespassing Case**: 30-day municipal sentence vs. state 10 days.<grok:render card_id="669b75" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render>

- **Denver Obstruction Case (Pro-Palestine Rally)**: Municipal max 30x longer than state.<grok:render card_id="b89d1c" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">42</argument>
</grok:render>

- **Broader ACLU Involvement**: The ACLU of Colorado has filed amicus briefs in multiple cases (e.g., Camp/Simons) and older reports like "Justice Derailed" (2017) highlighting unconstitutional practices in municipal courts, including disproportionate sentencing for low-income defendants.<grok:render card_id="c166ee" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">50</argument>
</grok:render> A 2024 amicus in Camp noted Pueblo's illegal sentencing of vulnerable people.<grok:render card_id="d5073f" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">45</argument>
</grok:render> No large-scale class actions are documented, but these cases influenced 2025 legislative attempts (e.g., vetoed HB 25-1147 to cap municipal sentences).

Overall, while exact counts are elusive (possibly due to decentralized municipal codes), reporting suggests the practice was common in home-rule cities, affecting thousands via disparities. Post-ruling, cities must align penalties, reducing future issues. If you need deeper dives into specific cities or PDFs, let me know.
