Yeah I'm concerned about mental health and stress because he's had issues like that and then he was a team lead in the Special Forces but and then I know people have an alive in themself in that field that had a family and lost their homes and everything and you know it's really bad business to you know it's really bad business to do that it's bad humanity and it bleeds down and I just don't see my son doing that I never see him advertise I don't he doesn't put anything on his Facebook he's embarrassed to even say he was in the military so that's kind of his personality I don't know if that's confidence or he doesn't like to people to know all his stuff and I'm like it's like the worst thing to get into because you have to advertise I was thinking he was a sales representative for the water company and I was I thought it was doing more of the the grunt work but I was thinking like getting a water certificate I don't know but you know they got to want to do it but I mean that would be around for a long time and you could probably move up fast to a like a top worker like water is a the grunt work but I was thinking like getting a water certificate I don't know but you know they got to want to do it but I mean that would be around for a long time and you could probably move up fast to a like a top worker like water is a big thing
