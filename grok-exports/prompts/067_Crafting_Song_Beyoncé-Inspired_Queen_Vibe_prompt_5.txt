So I use Donna and what I like about Donna is I do a voice file and so I can't create a song with my voice right away it's going to create it with a artist in the or whatever they use in the music program but after it's created I can then do that what they call a cover and I can take a song that I created and then I can do what's called a cover and it will put my voice in there with my sound file and I don't know if all those do that but I think I think maybe I've Gotten Good at doing this now and maybe I need to kind of upgrade since my skill levels increased and I'd like it I don't know how to do da but I would prefer to just edit the program I'm hearing cuz I don't know how I don't know how to do a d a w file and for me a Daw file does no longer sound like the song I'm creating and I can't figure that out I wish I could edit the song as it is with easier tools that don't require sometimes I just want to change the way I said a word or I said the word wrong or I want to change like a high note that's cracking and another thing I don't like is it feels like they always generate an error in every song because I have a pretty steady voice and it doesn't seem quite as high as I can which is understandable but it feels like I guess you're getting hissing and popping at a top note and it sounds like I'm not hitting it but it's not that it's that it's that it's cracking because it's like not balanced right
