I'm not hysterical or anger angry or anything I'm just trying to get data because I do read a lot just I have SSDI it is a freaking hardest thing to get you have to see three different doctors that they have and you have to have multiple referrals so the doctors don't know each other my counselor doesn't know my cardiologist.
