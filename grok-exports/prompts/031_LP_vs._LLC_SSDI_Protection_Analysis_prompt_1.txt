# Prompt from: LP vs. LLC: SSDI Protection Analysis

Conversation ID: conv_31

---

Can you research this more Choose Limited Partnership IF:
Want absolute strongest SSDI protection
Don't mind slightly higher cost ($528 vs $264/year)
Want clearest possible "passive" classification
Don't need to impress investors (LPs seem old-school)
Choose Multi-Member LLC IF:
Want simpler management
Cost matters ($264/year)
Comfortable documenting passive role
More modern business structure
Easier to explain to people
Tax deductions? IDENTICAL.
The question isn't "which has more writeoffs?" but rather "which structure best protects your SSDI while allowing the same tax benefits?"
