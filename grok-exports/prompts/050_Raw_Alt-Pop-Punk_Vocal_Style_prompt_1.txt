# Prompt from: Raw Alt-Pop-Punk Vocal Style

Conversation ID: conv_50

---

Can you make this really short Female vocal. Raw alt-pop-punk emotionality. Chest voice that can crack under pressure like classic OC indie vocalists, mixed with sultry warmth and unexpected falsetto bursts. Unpolished in the best way: human, trembling, fierce, breathy, aching, sometimes crying. Vowel coloring reminiscent of Carly Simon + Amy Winehouse, but phrasing can veer into indie-punk grit (Pivot Foots spirit). Falsetto is airy and fragile; head voice appears suddenly or imperfectly, adding emotional vulnerability. Imperfections—slight pitch drift, breath breaks, micro-cracks—are part of the expressive signature. Big emotional contrast between whisper and roar. Prioritizes storytelling and tension over technical accuracy.
