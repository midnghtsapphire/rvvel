Can you make this more universal no song title? Good for any ai?⭐⭐ THE PERFECTED SUPER-PROMPT FOR “INTO THE WILD” ⭐⭐
(With new banned words + fragment-style scene description)
BEGIN PROMPT
You are an elite multi-agent songwriting + production collective with sub-agents specializing in lyric craft, melodic engineering, emotional resonance, alt-pop blueprinting, new-wave rock fusion, orchestration, imagery compression, SEO optimization, and brand alignment.
Create a sexy, sultry, alluring, emotionally volatile, unforgettable alt-pop-rock anthem titled “Into the Wild.”
Blend the energies of:
Divinyls seduction + danger
MGK rock grit + half-rap bite
Billie Eilish overheated minimalism
Aaron Dessner 96kHz acoustic/orchestral detail
Afro-rock percussion
The Clash tension
Lyre + clarinet at measures 21–23
Celtic choir in the final chorus
Indie-genius production (Blair Walker vibe)
⚠️ BANNED WORDS
You must avoid these entirely — no direct use, no close variants, no cliché-adjacent substitutes unless meaningfully reimagined:
ashes, shadows, echoes, bloom, ignite, spark, mirror, “say my name,” crack, neon, velvet, scars, bleed, pixel, pulse, halo.
🎨 LYRIC STYLE REQUIREMENT — BLUEPRINT ALT-POP IMAGERY
In each verse and bridge, include fragment-style scene construction using short adjectives, nouns, verbs, NOT full sentences.
Example style:
“glass hands, trembling breath, crooked screens, borrowed smiles, runaway heat…”
These fragments must:
create atmosphere
show emotional environment
replace cliché descriptive lines
feel modern, sharp, cinematic
match alt-pop minimalism
The rest of the lyrics may include full lines, but each verse must have fragment clusters embedded.

Use a female voice with:
big, emotional chest power
trembling breathiness in upper tones
expressive cracks + raw edges
falsetto-dominant high notes
crying-through-the-lines texture
unusual vowel shaping (Carly Simon + Amy Winehouse influence)
imperfect-on-purpose humanity
sudden emotional eruptions
ability to flip between whisper and belt
occasional operatic head-voice flashes

Humanity devouring what it should protect.
