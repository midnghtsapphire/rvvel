To generate a best-in-class, comprehensive website design or audit using AI, a prompt must be highly structured, covering user experience (UX), conversion rate optimization (CRO), search engine optimization (SEO), and technical, functional elements. 
Here is a breakdown of every component to include, structured as a "Best-in-Class" prompt.
1. The Structure of a Best-in-Class Prompt
A high-performing prompt should follow this structure to ensure no component is missed: 
Role/Persona: Define the AI as a senior expert (e.g., "You are a world-class Web Strategist and UI/UX Designer").
Goal: Explicitly state the outcome (e.g., "Design a high-converting landing page for [Product]").
Context: Detail the industry, target audience, and unique selling proposition (USP).
Constraints: Set boundaries (e.g., "minimalist style," "max 3-second load time," "WCAG 2.1 compliance").
Components List: Explicitly list the website parts to include. 
2. Every Part of a Website to Include in the Prompt 
Header/Navigation: Simple, intuitive navigation, logo placement, and primary CTA button.
Hero Section (Above the Fold): A clear, value-driven headline (what you do + why care), subheadline, hero image/video, and primary CTA.
Social Proof/Trust Signals: Client logos, testimonials, reviews, case studies, or security badges.
Value Proposition & Benefits: Focusing on benefits over features, using bullet points for readability.
Service/Product Overview: Clearly showcased product highlights.
Conversion Points: Prominent, contrasting buttons (CTA) for booking/purchasing, scattered throughout the page.
Lead Capture/Form: A simple form (1–3 fields) or exit-intent popup.
Footer: Essential links (Privacy Policy, Contact, Social Media).
Technical/Mobile Optimization: Responsive design for mobile (over 60% of traffic) and fast loading speed components. 
3. Best-in-Class Prompt Template
Copy and customize this template for your needs:
Role: Act as a Senior CRO Specialist and Lead Web Designer.
Goal: Create a comprehensive website structure, content plan, and UX design layout for [Name of Business/Service]. The primary goal is [e.g., lead generation/direct sales].
Context:
Target Audience: [Describe audience]
Product/Service: [Brief description]
Key Value Prop: [What makes you unique]
Desired Tone: [e.g., Professional, Playful, Authoritative]
Required Components & Structure:
Please define the layout and copy for the following sections, ensuring they work together to maximize conversion:
Header: Logo, clean navigation, and a "Contact Us" CTA button.
Hero Section: Benefit-driven H1, H2, and a high-contrast Call-to-Action.
Trust Section: "Trusted by" section with logos or testimonials.
Problem/Solution: Explain the customer’s pain point and how we solve it.
Features/Benefits: 3-column breakdown of benefits.
Final CTA: Strong, persuasive closing argument with a button.
Footer: Contact details and legal links.
Constraints & Guidelines:
Visual Hierarchy: Use F or Z-pattern layout to guide the eye.
Mobile First: Prioritize mobile experience.
Copywriting: Use action-oriented, concise language (e.g., "Start Free Trial" not "Submit").
Design: Modern, minimalist, and high-contrast for readability.
Output: Please provide the output as a detailed, page-by-page wireframe description, including suggested headlines, button text, and image placeholders.
 
4. Tips for Best Results
Use Delimiters: Use ### or """ to separate sections within the prompt.
Iterate: If the first result is generic, ask the AI to "focus more on the emotional, high-conversion, and psychological aspect of the CTA".
Few-Shot Prompting: Provide an example of a site you admire to help the AI learn your desired style.
