I wanna do a song same meaning and vibe as rascal flatts what hurts the most drenched in emotion

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then, and just let 'em out
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while even though
Going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again
I pretend I'm okay
But that's not what gets me
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do
It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doing it
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends
And I'm alone
Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, living with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And having so much to say (much to say)
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do
Oh
Hey, yeah
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say (much to say)
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do
Not seeing that love in you
That's what I was trying to do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
