CRSPR is our best defense, is a good offense. That's who needs the backup. They forgo high-value, anti-aging remedies for preemptory and premeditative research on cancer and disease as it is accidently inclusive. Disease that influcts, "pop-goes-the-weasle", rearing its ugly thorny head, at historically younger ages like leukemia, brain tumors, lymphomas, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, bone cancers, and certain types of heart conditions. Their Refined treatment using AI will automatically build the framework for longevity. It is called geroscience, Gerotherapeutics (or Geroprotectors). I replied to gates post in the image. Can we research this topic more based on my response to the problem? Good and bad?
