I mean medicine said that they they bite and basically forced them to remove accounts and do all kinds of stuff that was pretty much illegal some of these people had their whole income were relied on their accounts that had like a million people and they just deleted them without any real reason and he admitted that he pulled them and that's just one incidence of this censoring and I can tell you as a victim of a violent crime and assault sexual assault I can tell you we're not even allowed to talk about it anymore even as a victim they pretty much silence the victims which makes me feel like it this is intentional because of the Epstein files because we know a lot of these people are involved in this child pedophile ring that are in these high companies and so I think it it so I think it it was part I might get uncovered so they put heavy filtering so you couldn't even talk about stuff if you're a victim people can't put rape anymore they have to put grape what kind of world is that we have to put on alive and we can't say dad killed that's ridiculous
