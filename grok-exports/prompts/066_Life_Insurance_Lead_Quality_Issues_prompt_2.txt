ow Automation Tools Handle Multiple Sources:
n8n:
You CAN use multiple connectors in ONE workflow
It's node-based (like a flowchart)
Gmail node → connects to → Spreadsheet node → connects to → Supabase node
All in the same automation
Zapier:
Called "Multi-Step Zaps"
Each step can be a different service
Step 1: Gmail trigger
Step 2: Google Sheets lookup
Step 3: Supabase update
All in one Zap
Make (Integromat):
Best for complex multi-source workflows
Visual flowchart
Can pull from 5 different APIs in one scenario
Then combine and output to one place
For Your Lead De-Duper App:
You probably want Make or n8n because you need to:
Pull from Lead Source API #1
Pull from Lead Source API #2
Pull from Lead Source API #3
Combine all data
Find duplicates (by phone/email)
Output clean list to Supabase
That's multiple sources → one workflow → one output
But Here's the KISS Approach:
Don't automate the lead pulling at first. Just let agents:
Upload their CSV files (from wherever they bought leads)
Your app de-dupes them
Shows clean list
No API connections needed. Just file upload → processing → output.
Why this is better:
Works with ANY lead source
No API keys to manage
Agent has full control
Simpler to build
Faster to launch
Start simple: Upload → De-Dupe → Download Clean List
That's your MVP. Does that make more sense for getting the first version out?
