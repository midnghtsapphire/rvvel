. Abronson Law Offices: Updated Deep Dive (Background, Origin, Cases, News, Reviews)
Background & Origin: Boutique PI firm in San Jose, CA (332 N. Second St., 95112; ph: 408-687-9155 or 408-444-7700). Founded by Louis S. Abronson (owner/manager, with Of Counsel William H. Abronson)—focus on plaintiff-side negligence (car/truck/motorcycle accidents, slips/falls, construction, med mal, wrongful death, defective products). Client-first: Virtual consults for accessibility; guide on insurance fights for max comp (med bills, lost wages, pain/suffering). No explicit origin story on site; likely evolved from Louis's litigation roots (decades in PI, per Avvo). "Red House Lawyer" domain? Still no etymology—possibly a branding play for "home base" in injury recovery (metaphorical safe haven). Hook: "Your virtual consults align with my hybrid exp—how's that scaled post-2023?"
Notable Cases (From site + scans—no new 2023-2025 dockets popped, but these anchors):
$16M Wrongful Death Judgment: Repped children of murdered parents—landmark for family trauma/impact damages. (Site highlight; implies strong jury play in Santa Clara Superior.)
Hagerstrand Case: Referenced on site (details sparse—likely PI verdict/settlement; no outcome specified). Inference: 80-90% settlement rate (industry norm for PI); they litigate "winnable injustices" like med mal. No authored appellate law found (boutiques prioritize trials/settles over precedents).
