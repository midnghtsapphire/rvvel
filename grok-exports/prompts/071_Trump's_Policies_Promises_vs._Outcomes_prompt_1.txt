Using peer-reviewed studies, official ICE statistics, and journalistic records, analyze how Donald Trump’s key promises (e.g. tax cuts favoring big business, dismantling USAID, stricter immigration enforcement) match actual outcomes. Quantify:

1. US vs. Corporate tax burden shifts since Trump’s tax policies.


2. Projected additional deaths globally and in the US due to USAID cuts—broken down by age and region, with temporal projections.


3. ICE enforcement data (civil vs. criminal detainees), US citizen wrongful arrests, and documented ICE-agent crimes.


4. Evidence for or against ICE using bounty hunters; number of ‘disappeared’ individuals.


5. Butterfly effect analysis: cascading social, economic, public health, geopolitical consequences of these policies—using models and case studies.


6. Include verification with credible sources and counterpoints.”

Please provide Real-world accuracy with links or credit to the resources and use direct retrieval from verified databases, government sources (like IRS, DHS, ICE, USAID), credible media outlets (e.g., The Guardian, Washington Post), or peer-reviewed studies (e.g., Lancet).
