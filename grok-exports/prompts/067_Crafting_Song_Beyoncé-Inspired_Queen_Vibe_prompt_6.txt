This is really helpful I didn't know those tools were there I can afford to pay for a tool I want the app to do as much as it can autonomously before including me because some of these songs are really good and I don't want to destroy them I do have a composer now but we're we're going to strip out the vocals and he'll correct and add stuff he plays every instrument and then I have to sing these new and I'm not really ready to do all that right now I think I want to do a little more lessons and I like this where I hear my voice it sounds like me available right now and it's I just had a mastectomy and a lot of stuff with cancer so I can't I can't sit in my house and sing this loud for every song
