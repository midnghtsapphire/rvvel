Conversation ID: conv_67

Here's often the problem and using like a music app and I really write all My Own lyrics and I know what I want it to sound like I literally have to go and craft the best prompt I can to get the sound I want because I don't know how to work all the tools and all that so I have to do like 20 to get one song which is actually not bad but I have to do a lot to get the sound I want and I wish what happens is that I'll put the normal formatting in and sometimes they follow it but sometimes they put the formatting in the song and the and it's a song that would have been perfect had they not done that and I don't have the tools to fix it so it kind of sucks I also want to be able to I know like keyboards or Electronics can make sound like a whistle it can make a sound like a train it can make a sound like bees I want to know how to say that to like an AI music app
