Not just Social Security I think he's trying to end like if we go bankrupt then we no longer have social security disability those are probably the first things I know I don't know how they could do that it would cause the Civil War or like a war and set our country but it just seems that way to me because he is lied about every single thing the farmers are are all losing their land so his saying he loves the farmers isn't true and then he did the meat thing with Venezuela so he he literally doesn't work for us I feel like it's Revenge on people that have used the system that they are allowed people that have used the system that they are allowed to use everybody that uses it is a derelict you know kind of a low life even I you know kind of a low life even I think if I've seen your citizens have managed to have like a 401k an extra money then he figures well those are the good people and they can survive without it and anybody else didn't spend their money right or whatever and so he's more than willing to get rid of it and I'm talking about all grants to police departments and funding to where he literally can control everything better because if there's no money the federal government can't give it to the states so I just to get and he's spending more than any president has ever spent and he's putting up a huge changing the White House with a multi 330 million dollar project when we're in the worst debt we've ever been in and they're threatening us with the government going bankrupt something is weird
