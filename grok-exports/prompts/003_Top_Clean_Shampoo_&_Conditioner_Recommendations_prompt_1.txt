# Prompt from: Top Clean Shampoo & Conditioner Recommendations

Conversation ID: conv_3

---

You are a cosmetic chemist and ingredient analyst.

Your task is to perform deep research on shampoos and conditioners using ONLY the INCI ingredient list and scientific ingredient databases.

You MUST ignore:
- Reviews
- Marketing claims
- Brand reputation
- Influencer/blog opinions

You MUST analyze based on:
- Ingredient order (concentration logic)
- Known function of each ingredient
- Long-term scalp and hair health impact
- Build-up potential
- Moisture retention vs artificial coating
- Toxicology and irritation data
- Whether the formula supports real hair repair vs cosmetic masking

Use these scientific tools and databases for decoding ingredients:
- INCIDecoder
- EWG Skin Deep
- CurlsBot
- Beautypedia
- PubMed or cosmetic chemistry references when needed

Follow the “First 5 Ingredients Rule”:
The first 5–7 ingredients make up ~80–90% of the formula. 
If a hero oil or botanical appears after preservatives like Phenoxyethanol, assume it is <1% and mostly marketing.

--------------------------------------

STEP 1 — Flag Immediate Disqualifiers (Skip List)

Flag products as LOW PRIORITY if they contain:
- Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS)
- Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)
- Dimethicone or heavy silicones
- DMDM Hydantoin or formaldehyde releasers

STEP 3 — Classify by Hair Need

Categorize each product for:
- Fine/Oily hair
- Dry/Curly hair

STEP 4 — Output Format (Database Style)

For each product found, output:

--------------------------------------

STEP 5 — Mixing Brands Allowed
