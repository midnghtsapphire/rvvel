And I am riding a whole system for capture lock that probably isn't practical but it's only if somebody just took some of the ideas or used it to create their own ideasThe provided sources explore the systemic risks of AI-enabled authoritarianism and the "capture" of democratic institutions by powerful tech oligarchs. To counter these threats, the texts propose a Constellation Architecture, which replaces singular AI models with a distributed network of specialized, autonomous agents designed to provide mutual oversight. This framework aims to preserve human agency and truth through cryptographic anchoring, decentralized governance, and tiered trust verification.
