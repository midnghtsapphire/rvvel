What does reassuring mean and I do I mean the only way out for of this type of debt for us I mean it's not going to get better the only way out is to manufacture here and it's just like when people go to war and they have to start manufacturing weapons and stuff in their country like it creates a lot of money so either a war or if we went bankrupt and we saw that we had to start creating all our own stuff here it would be painful for a minute but it would it would create the kind of money not right away but within you know 10 years that we need but another another problem is the grants for manufacturing as it's like cronyism so you're only seeing the big top companies get these grants and they might sift a few off to pretty large smaller businesses but none of pretty large smaller businesses but none of these grants helps my business
