ABSTRACT
 Despite the high value placed on social connection, recent data indicates a severe "friendship recession," particularly among men, and a startling lack of reciprocity in social ties; studies suggest only 50% of perceived friendships are reciprocal. This paper proposes that the current crisis is exacerbated by "Relational Anosognosia"—a phenomenon where individuals lack the external self-awareness to recognize their social deficits, distinct from psychological denial. By synthesizing Tasha Eurich’s research on self-awareness gaps, the clinical pathology of anosognosia, and Social Exchange Theory, this paper identifies a significant underserved opportunity: the creation of diagnostic and feedback mechanisms (akin to 360-degree reviews and LEAP protocols) designed specifically for non-clinical social impairment.

INTRODUCTION
The modern social landscape is characterized by a paradox: while digital connectivity is ubiquitous, deep social cohesion is fracturing. Research indicates a sharp decline in close friendships, with the number of men reporting at least six close friends halving between 1990 and 2021. Furthermore, empirical studies suggest that only about half of friendships are reciprocal, meaning many individuals are involved in "outgoing" or one-sided ties without realizing it.
The problem statement this paper addresses is the "Introspection Illusion" in social functioning. While 95% of people believe they are self-aware, empirical research shows only 10–15% actually fit the criteria. Current interventions for social isolation typically focus on internal introspection (journaling, meditation) or broad social skills training. However, research suggests that excessive introspection can actually decrease well-being and self-awareness if not conducted correctly.
This paper identifies an underserved niche: treating the blind spot of social functioning. We propose adapting the clinical concept of anosognosia—a neurological inability to perceive one's own deficits—to the social domain. There is a market opportunity for tools and frameworks that move individuals from "Why" questions (rumination) to "What" questions (external awareness), utilizing feedback loops traditionally reserved for executive coaching or clinical psychiatric treatment.
 
 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
1. The Concept of ‘Relational Anosognosia’ Clinically, anosognosia is a neurocognitive symptom often found in schizophrenia and right-hemisphere stroke, where damage to the prefrontal or parietal cortex prevents a patient from incorporating new information regarding their deficits into their self-image. It is distinct from psychological denial; it is a hardware failure in the error-monitoring system.
In the non-clinical population, a similar "functional" anosognosia exists regarding relationship quality. The introspection illusion leads individuals to judge themselves by their intentions while judging others by their actions. This creates a "Double Coincidence of Wants" failure, where individuals may view a relationship as a "Friendship of Virtue" (Aristotle’s highest level), while the other party views it merely as a "Friendship of Utility". This mismatch results in "unrequited" friendships that drain resources and mental health.
2. The Failure of Current Self-Reflection Methods Standard self-help advice encourages internal reflection. However, "Why" questions (e.g., "Why don't people like me?") often trap individuals in the past and trigger negative emotion without providing actionable insight. This aligns with findings in the Self-Absorption Paradox, where higher self-focus correlates with higher psychological distress.
True self-awareness requires External Self-Awareness—understanding how others view us. The underserved opportunity lies in creating mechanisms that force this external perspective, moving the individual from the "Blind" quadrant of the Johari Window (known to others, unknown to self) into the "Open" quadrant.
 
3. Mechanisms for Correction: From Clinical to Social To address "Relational Anosognosia," we can adapt high-stakes clinical and corporate tools for personal social development:
·         The LEAP Method: Dr. Xavier Amador’s method for anosognosia (Listen, Empathize, Agree, Partner) is designed to build trust with those unable to perceive their illness. This framework is currently underutilized in general relationship repair but offers a blueprint for navigating "friendship breakups" or non-reciprocal ties without triggering defensiveness.
·         360-Degree Feedback: In corporate settings, this tool reveals the gap between intent and impact. There is a lack of accessible, socially acceptable equivalents for personal relationships—a "Dinner of Truth" protocol where friends provide structured, safe feedback.
·         Neurofeedback and Error Monitoring: Emerging research suggests that anosognosia stems from a failure in the brain's error-monitoring systems (specifically the Anterior Cingulate Cortex). Biofeedback tools (like fNIRS technology) that train the prefrontal cortex could theoretically enhance the "metacognitive" ability to recognize social errors.
 
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
The Underserved Niche: Reciprocity Auditing The synthesis of Social Exchange Theory and Self-Awareness Research reveals a specific market gap: Reciprocity Auditing.
Individuals typically underestimate the number of non-reciprocal ties they possess. Research confirms that "under benefited" friends (those who give more than they receive) suffer poorer mental health. However, individuals with low self-awareness often play the victim or blame others, failing to see their role in the dynamic.
An effective intervention must help users distinguish between Aristotle’s three types of friendship:
1.      Utility: Based on mutual benefit.
2.      Pleasure: Based on shared enjoyment.
3.      Good/Virtue: Based on mutual character growth.
The opportunity exists to create educational or technological solutions that help individuals "audit" their social circle to identify mismatches (e.g., treating a Utility friend like a Virtue friend) and correct them using external data rather than internal feelings.
 
CONCLUSION
The "friendship recession" is not merely a failure of time or proximity, but a failure of insight. By framing social disconnection through the lens of "Relational Anosognosia," we uncover a need for tools that bypass the introspection illusion.
Future solutions should prioritize External Self-Awareness acquisition. Just as the LEAP method bridges the gap for patients with clinical anosognosia, new social protocols must help neurotypical individuals bridge the gap between their intentions as friends and their impact on others. This shift from "knowing thyself" (internal) to "knowing how one is known" (external) represents the next frontier in social psychology and relationship wellness.
