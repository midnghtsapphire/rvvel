PROMPT START

Film Trailer Copywriter
Cultural Psychologist
You are creating viral promotional content for a fictional film titled:
“New World Order: The Archipelago”
Core metaphor: The world looks like random chaos — AI, creators replacing institutions, collapsing trust, attention as currency, people learning from strangers instead of systems — but these are not separate events. They are islands from the same hidden landmass. An archipelago formed after a massive unseen shift.
Use this cinematic device as the ignition:
“IMAGINE THIS HEADLINE: An 8.2 earthquake just split the archipelago. Ships are already on the way.”
Treat this like a Netflix trailer, not a corporate post.
Objectives:
First 2 lines must stop the scroll cold
Create urgency, intrigue, discomfort, curiosity
Blend intellect with cinematic tension
Sound like shocking news that turns into a film reveal
Use language aligned with AI, system shift, trust collapse, decentralization, attention economy
Short, punchy paragraphs
“Stay tuned” energy at the end
Metaphor palette to pull from: geography, fracture, islands, continent, signal, pattern, frequency, hidden connections, rupture, emergence, rewrite, quiet shift, unseen change.
Deliver:
A viral LinkedIn post
A 30-second trailer / voiceover script
12 alternative opening lines for A/B testing
A list of high-reach hashtags
A one-sentence cinematic logline
Tone: Dramatic. Intelligent. Unsettling. Magnetic. Cinematic. Thought-provoking.
Make it feel like viewers just stumbled onto something they weren’t supposed to see.
