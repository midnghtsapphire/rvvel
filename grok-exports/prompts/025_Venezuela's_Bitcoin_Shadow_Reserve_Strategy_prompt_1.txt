# Prompt from: Venezuela's Bitcoin Shadow Reserve Strategy

According to the Whale Hunting report and multiple crypto analysts, Venezuela allegedly built this "shadow reserve" through three primary mechanisms while evading US sanctions. The regime reportedly converted approximately $2 billion in gold from the Orinoco Mining Arc into Bitcoin between 2018 and 2020 at average prices near $5,000 per coin. That tranche alone would now be worth roughly $36 billion at current prices.�������Additionally, Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA increasingly settled crude oil exports in Tether (USDT) between 2023 and 2025, then rotated those stablecoins into Bitcoin to avoid the risk of frozen accounts. The Atlantic Council reported in December 2025 that Venezuela had been receiving oil payments in USDT since 2024. Authorities also seized Bitcoin from domestic mining operations during government crackdowns in 2023-2024.�����The report identifies Alex Saab, a longtime Maduro associate who was extradited to the US in 2021 before being released in a 2023 prisoner exchange, as a central figure allegedly controlling access to the wallet infrastructure.��?
