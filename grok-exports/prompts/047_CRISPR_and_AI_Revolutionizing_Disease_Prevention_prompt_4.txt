I'm really trying to not be that altruistic or designing it like for fun but I was like that movie even though it was a long time ago has some properties and even that one with actually he's got Parkinson's girls timers there's an older one where I have to remember the name of it I can't remember stuff so I'm worried that I'm getting Parkinson's because both my parents have but I really haven't slept much but what I'm saying is there can we we can create two different formulations but is there a way to there can we we can create two different formulations but is there a way to create one formula that detects or knows Alzheimer's or Parkinson's and it can block whatever it needs based formula that detects or knows Alzheimer's or Parkinson's and it can block whatever it needs based on that so like if the person has Parkinson's and they need the iron block in the brain it would do that but I and this is what I need you to compare what they both need and which ones have what they don't need
